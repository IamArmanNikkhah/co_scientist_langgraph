Portfolio vol \u03c3_s(w) = sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w).\n- Decision problem (SOCP):\n  maximize t\n  subject to \u2200 s: w' u_s \u2265 t \u00b7 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w||        (Sharpe_s \u2265 t)\n               ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| \u2264 \u03c3_cap               (vol cap, \u03c3_cap = 0.15)\n               1' w = 1, w \u2265 0\n- The constraints w' u_s \u2265 t \u00b7 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| are second\u2011order cone constraints; the program is an SOCP solvable by standard solvers (ECOS, MOSEK, SCS) and convex\u2011optimization toolkits (CVX, CVXPY).\n- Baseline scenario parameterization (Expert A\u2019s recommended numerical inputs \u2014 all figures annualized excess returns and stdevs):\n  - Status Quo (SQ): u_SQ = [0.06, 0.08, 0.03]; \u03c3 = [0.35, 0.20, 0.10]; \u03c1_TG=0.20, \u03c1_TF=0.10, \u03c1_GF=0.00.\n  - Conflict Escalation (CE): u_CE = [\u22120.25, 0.30, \u22120.10]; \u03c3 = [0.60, 0.40, 0.30]; \u03c1_TG=\u22120.20, \u03c1_TF=0.60, \u03c1_GF=\u22120.30.\n  - Diplomatic Normalization (DN): u_DN = [0.30, 0.10, 0.05]; \u03c3 = [0.25, 0.15, 0.08]; \u03c1_TG=0.10, \u03c1_TF=0.20, \u03c1_GF=0.00.\n  - Construct \u03a3_s from \u03c3 and \u03c1 in the standard way.\n- Rationale for the proposed point allocation:\n  - Conflict scenario produces deep negative equity returns and high equity volatility while making gold relatively attractive as a hedge \u2192 optimizer favors gold to raise worst\u2011case Sharpe.\n  - Fixed income provides lower volatility ballast and positive floor to satisfy the \u03c3_cap and raise worst\u2011case Sharpe under status quo and normalization.\n  - Equities are limited (20%) to capture upside in normalization but constrained to prevent extreme downside under conflict.\n- Robustness and validation steps to test/falsify:\n  - Solve the SOCP exactly with the listed u_s and \u03a3_s to compute the true maximizing w* and worst\u2011case Sharpe t*.\n  - Sensitivity checks: \u00b120% perturbations to u_s, alternative \u03c3_cap values (10\u201318%), and adding ellipsoidal uncertainty sets on u_s or \u03a3_s (robust SOCP) to confirm allocation stability.\n  - Alternative objectives to compare: maximize worst\u2011case Sortino, or add CVaR bounds for tail protection.\n- Practical implementation notes: enforce operational floors/ceilings if required (e.g., min FI \u2265 10% or max TSE \u2264 60%) as linear constraints in the SOCP. Use annualized returns and covariances consistent with local currency inflation indexing (use real or excess returns over a locally relevant short\u2011term cash proxy).\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable by explicitly solving the stated SOCP with the specified scenario parameterization and volatility cap. If the SOCP produces a different allocation w\u0302 that yields a strictly larger minimum annualized Sharpe Ratio across the three scenarios than the proposed w* = [0.20, 0.45, 0.35], or if w* violates any feasibility constraint (weights sum to 1, nonnegativity, vol cap per scenario), then the hypothesis is falsified. Likewise, if sensitivity/robustness analyses (\u00b120% parameter perturbations or ellipsoidal uncertainty) yield consistent allocations materially different from w* (beyond practical tolerance), the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. The three scenarios (SQ, CE, DN) and their numeric parameterizations (u_s, \u03a3_s) adequately capture the relevant 10\u2011year Iran macro/geopolitical outcomes and are the correct inputs for the investor\u2019s subjective beliefs.\n2. Excess returns (\u03bc \u2212 rf) are the appropriate return metric for Sharpe computation; local short\u2011term cash proxy chosen for excess returns is well\u2011defined even under inflation.\n3. A single static (no\u2011rebalance) allocation over the full 10\u2011year horizon is appropriate for this investor\u2019s objectives and constraints.\n4. Volatility is measured as annualized standard deviation from the scenario covariance matrices and must not exceed \u03c3_cap = 0.15 in each scenario.\n5. No short selling is allowed; only the three asset classes may be held.\n6. Second\u2011order cone formulation is numerically well\u2011posed given \u03a3_s positive definiteness (apply shrinkage if needed).\n7. Behavioral/regulatory constraints (taxes, illiquidity of some funds) are either negligible or can be represented later by simple linear constraints.\n\nI accept option A (use the SOCP minimax\u2011Sharpe formulation and the numeric scenario point estimates as the baseline) for final computation and reporting.",

Robust variants incorporate box uncertainty on expected returns (\u00b13 percentage points) and a +10% covariance scaling sensitivity; the optimal solution is found by bisection on the worst\u2011case Sharpe and SOCP feasibility checks.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nObjective (minimax Sharpe, nominal):\n- Let w \u2208 R^3 be weights [w_TSE, w_Gold, w_FI], w \u2265 0, 1\u2032w = 1.\n- For each scenario s \u2208 {Status, Conflict, Normal}, let \u03bc_s \u2208 R^3 be annual nominal expected returns, \u03a3_s \u2208 R^{3\u00d73} the annual covariance matrix, and r_f,s the annual nominal short\u2011term yield.\n- Define Sharpe_s(w) = (w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s) / sqrt(w\u2032\u03a3_s w).\n- Maximize t subject to Sharpe_s(w) \u2265 t for all s.\n\nMathematical program (SOC\u2011representable for fixed t \u2014 solved by bisection on t):\nmaximize t\nsubject to, \u2200 s:\n  w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s \u2265 t \u00b7 sqrt(w\u2032\u03a3_s w)\nsum_i w_i = 1\nw_i \u2208 [lb_i, ub_i] (no shorting)\nsqrt(w\u2032\u03a3_Status w) \u2264 0.15  (primary volatility cap on Status Quo)\nIf infeasible, one\u2011time relax cap \u2192 0.18 and re\u2011solve.\n\nRecommended hard bounds (life\u2011stage / moderate risk):\n- w_TSE \u2208 [0.15, 0.60]\n- w_Gold \u2208 [0.00, 0.35]\n- w_FI \u2208 [0.25, 0.70]\n\nScenario parameterization (nominal annual; starting inputs for optimization \u2014 to be adjusted by expert elicitation if desired):\n- Status Quo: \u03bc = [TSE +18%, Gold +15%, FI +22%]; \u03c3 = [40%, 25%, 12%]; \u03c1(TSE,Gold)=+0.1, \u03c1(TSE,FI)=+0.2, \u03c1(Gold,FI)=0.0; r_f = 20%.\n- Conflict Escalation: \u03bc = [TSE \u221230%, Gold +50%, FI +60%]; \u03c3 = [70%, 40%, 30%]; \u03c1(TSE,Gold)=\u22120.3, \u03c1(TSE,FI)=0.0, \u03c1(Gold,FI)=+0.15; r_f = 50% (nominal).\n- Diplomatic Normalization: \u03bc = [TSE +40%, Gold +5%, FI +20%]; \u03c3 = [30%, 20%, 10%]; \u03c1(TSE,Gold)=0.0, \u03c1(TSE,FI)=+0.3, \u03c1(Gold,FI)=0.0; r_f = 10%.\n\nRobustness and sensitivity:\n- Nominal Sharpe optimization is primary. Also run a robust variant: worst\u2011case \u03bc_s within box \u03bc_s \u00b1 3 percentage points (\u00b13ppt) and covariance sensitivity scaling up to +10% (\u03a3_s \u2190 (1+\u03b4)\u03a3_s, \u03b4 \u2208 [0,0.10]). Solve minimax over scenarios and \u03bc\u2011ambiguity by evaluating constraints at worst\u2011case \u03bc in the box (finite worst\u2011case obtained by solving the inner minimization or by enumerating extreme points).\n- Compare bench allocations: (A) scenario\u2011weighted Sharpe optimizer (weights \u03b1_s, e.g., \u03b1 = [0.6,0.2,0.2]), (B) Black\u2013Litterman posterior blending the three views equally, and (C) conventional mean\u2011variance under same volatility cap.\n- Solver & numerical recipe: use CVXPY + MOSEK (or ECOS); implement outer bisection on t (tolerance 1e\u20113). For each t, solve SOC feasibility: linear constraints + SOC constraints (w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s \u2265 t\u00b7||L_s w||_2 where L_s is Cholesky of \u03a3_s) + volatility cap SOC.\n\nDeliverables to validate/compute:\n- Final static weights w*, achieved worst\u2011case annualized Sharpe t*.\n- Per\u2011scenario portfolio nominal expected returns, volatilities, and Sharpe ratios.\n- 10\u2011year nominal cumulative return projections per scenario (compounded).\n- Sensitivity reports: \u03bc \u00b13ppt worst case, \u03a3 +10% scaling, and one fallback run with volatility cap = 18% if primary infeasible.\n- Comparative allocations (scenario\u2011weighted and BL) and their worst\u2011case Sharpe metrics.\n\nPractical notes:\n- All returns and r_f are nominal. A real\u2011return sensitivity (using inflation expectations per scenario) should be reported subsequently.\n- The Status Quo volatility cap (15%) is chosen as the moderate\u2011risk constraint reflecting a 58\u2011year\u2011old preference for capital preservation while allowing growth. The one\u2011time 18% relaxation preserves feasibility without materially altering the robustness philosophy.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable: compute w* from the above procedure and record predicted worst\u2011case nominal annualized Sharpe t*. Over the 10\u2011year hold, compare realized scenario outcomes (mapped to the nearest scenario by observed macro variables). If the realized worst\u2011case annualized Sharpe experienced by w* across the realized scenarios is systematically and materially below the predicted t* (statistically significant shortfall given model uncertainty and sensitivities), or if alternative feasible static allocations (within the same bounds and volatility cap) produce a higher realized worst\u2011case Sharpe ex\u2011post, then the hypothesis is rejected. Additionally, if the optimization is infeasible under agreed constraints even after the single fallback relaxation, the assumption set is internally inconsistent and the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. Scenario definitions and numeric parameterizations (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f,s) reasonably represent plausible 10\u2011year Iran macro paths (Status Quo, Conflict, Normalization). These are inputs subject to expert refinement.\n2. Nominal return modeling is appropriate for investor decisions; inflation expectations and real\u2011return adjustments are treated in sensitivity analysis, not in the primary run.\n3. The investor accepts no shorting, full investment, and the stated weight bounds reflecting life stage and moderate risk tolerance.\n4. Volatility cap enforced on the Status Quo scenario (15%) adequately captures the investor\u2019s moderate\u2011risk constraint; a single fallback cap of 18% is permitted solely for feasibility.\n5. Returns distributions are summarized sufficiently by first and second moments for the Sharpe objective; higher\u2011moment effects and path\u2011dependence are partially addressed via scenario extremes and robust \u03bc/\u03a3 sensitivity, but not explicitly modeled.\n6. Solver accuracy (SOCP feasibility via CVXPY + MOSEK/ECOS) and bisection tolerance (1e\u20113 Sharpe) yield numerically stable and globally optimal solutions for the stated formulation.",

The resulting weight vector w* is the recommended single static allocation for the investor under the stated modeling choices; sensitivity analyses (semivariance Sharpe, scenario\u2011weighted objective, and floor/cap relaxations) will validate robustness.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nModel form (minimax Sharpe):\n- Decision vector: w = [w_TSE, w_Gold, w_FI], with w_i \u2265 0 and \u03a3_i w_i = 1.\n- For each scenario s in S = {StatusQuo, Conflict, Normalization} define annualized expected returns mu_s (3\u00d71), covariance Sigma_s (3\u00d73), and a short\u2011term nominal risk\u2011free proxy r_f_s (scalar).\n- Introduce scalar t (annualized Sharpe).

If, under independently estimated scenario parameter sets drawn from credible alternative data or out\u2011of\u2011sample realized returns over the next 10 years, the realized minimum annualized Sharpe is materially below t* (beyond sensitivity ranges reported), the practical effectiveness of the model/hypothesis is falsified.\n- Sensitivity falsification: if small perturbations within the declared uncertainty (\u00b15% mu, \u00b110% vol/corr) produce large, discontinuous shifts in w* or render the problem infeasible, the claimed robustness is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1) Scenario validity: the three scenario parameterizations credibly represent the relevant 10\u2011year macro outcomes for Iran (Status Quo, Conflict Escalation, Diplomatic Normalization). Unmodeled scenarios or probability shifts can change optimality.\n2) Stationarity within scenario: within each 10\u2011year scenario the annualized mu_s and Sigma_s are treated as constant (single\u2011period static allocation); no interim rebalancing is permitted.\n3) Investor preferences: a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor's moderate risk tolerance is captured by a per\u2011scenario annualized volatility cap of 15% and a fixed\u2011income floor of 30%.\n4) No shorting and full investment: weights nonnegative and sum to one.\n5) Risk\u2011free proxy: short\u2011term domestic nominal yields are an appropriate r_f_s; where missing, FI expected return is used with documented caveats.\n6) Risk measurement: Sharpe denominator is standard deviation (alternative semivariance variants reported for robustness).\n7) Numerical tractability: the conic reformulation and bisection approach produce reliable global feasibility tests for t; standard convex solvers produce accurate solutions under the declared tolerances.\n\nIf accepted, the next actionable step is to run the bisection+SOCP solver with these inputs and constraints, deliver w*, t*, per\u2011scenario metrics, and the robustness analyses enumerated above.",

The resulting allocation will be conservatively biased (limited TSE weight, material gold and fixed\u2011income) when calibrated to plausible Iran\u2011specific parameterizations, and the approach remains testable and implementable for a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor.\n\n#### Hypothesis Statement\nMaximize t\nsubject to, for each scenario s \u2208 {StatusQuo, Conflict, Normalization}:\n  (\u03bc_s_real' w \u2212 r_real_s) / sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) \u2265 t\n  sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) \u2264 \u03c3_cap (\u03c3_cap = 15% pa)\nplus linear constraints:\n  sum_i w_i = 1, w_i \u2265 0 (i \u2208 {TSE, Gold, FI})\nOptionally enforce age\u2011informed box bounds (tunable): w_TSE \u2264 0.30, w_FI \u2265 0.20, 0 \u2264 w_Gold \u2264 0.60.\nSolve by bisection on t where each feasibility test is an SOC problem (||\u03a3_s^(1/2) w||_2 \u2264 (\u03bc_s_real' w \u2212 r_real_s)/t and ||\u03a3_s^(1/2) w||_2 \u2264 \u03c3_cap). Report the maximized worst\u2011case annualized real Sharpe t* and the corresponding static weight vector w*.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nModeling choices\n- Performance metric: real Sharpe (use expected nominal returns \u03bc_s_nominal minus expected scenario inflation Einfl_s to form \u03bc_s_real; use real short\u2011rate r_real_s = r_nominal_s \u2212 Einfl_s or set to 0 where deposit rates lag inflation). This avoids misleading nominal Sharpe in high inflation regimes.\n- Scenario parameterization (to be calibrated from recent TSE, local gold (IRR) and fixed\u2011income yields + expert judgment):\n  - Status Quo: persistent sanctions, chronic inflation \u2014 moderate nominal gains for TSE, elevated vols; gold positive; FI nominal yields high but low/negative real.\n  - Conflict Escalation: direct conflict \u2192 hyperinflation, TSE crash, huge vol spike; gold strong positive; FI may have negative nominal/real expectations or high volatility.\n  - Diplomatic Normalization: sanctions relief \u2192 strong equity rally, compressed vol, gold flat/negative, FI yields compress.\n- Estimate \u03bc_s_nominal and \u03a3_s from data using monthly returns annualized, shrinkage (Ledoit\u2013Wolf) for \u03a3 stabilization, multiply vol by stress factors per scenario (Conflict: \u00d71.5\u20132.0). Build uncertainty sets \u03bc_s \u2208 [\u03bc\u0302_s \u00b1 \u03b4\u03bc] and \u03a3 perturbations for robustness checks.\n- Constraints: no short selling; sum to 1; per\u2011scenario volatility cap (hard) ensures \"moderate risk tolerance\" in each scenario. Optional practical box bounds encode age/liquidity preferences as sensitivity knobs.\n- Solution method: SOC\u2011bisection on t. For each t candidate solve convex feasibility with an SOC solver (MOSEK/GUROBI/ECOS via CVXPy). If \u03bc_s_real' w \u2212 r_real_s < 0 for some s then t>0 is infeasible \u2014 report t* = 0 then consider alternate metrics (Sortino/CVaR) or relax bounds.\n- Variants and robustness:\n  - Minimax Sortino: replace \u03c3 with downside deviation in denominator for downside\u2011focus.\n  - Weighted\u2011Sharpe alternative: maximize weighted average of scenario Sharpe (weights = scenario probabilities) for comparison.\n  - Robust counterpart: enforce constraints for worst \u03bc \u2208 ellipsoidal uncertainty set (more conservative).\n  - Tail constraints: add CVaR or worst\u2011year loss limits if investor needs explicit drawdown caps.\nImplementation deliverables\n- Calibrated baseline \u03bc_s_nominal, Einfl_s, \u03a3_s, r_nominal_s with uncertainty bounds.\n- CVXPy implementation of SOC\u2011bisection returning t* and w*.\n- Diagnostics: per\u2011scenario E[R] (real), \u03c3, Sharpe; sensitivity sweeps over \u03c3_cap (12\u201318%), box bounds, \u03bc/\u03c3 perturbations; CVaR and worst\u2011year loss simulations.\nExpected qualitative outcome\n- Given high TSE vol under plausible Iran conditions and a 15% cap, the minimax real\u2011Sharpe allocation will limit equity exposure (likely \u226430%), allocate materially to gold for tail hedging and to fixed\u2011income for income/liquidity. Exact weights require calibration and solver run; present both minimax and weighted\u2011Sharpe allocations for investor choice.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable by empirical model execution and counterexample:\n1) Implement the specified optimization with agreed scenario parameter sets and solver tolerances. If a feasible weight vector w exists that achieves a higher minimum scenario real Sharpe than the reported w* while satisfying all constraints (sum to 1, w\u22650, per\u2011scenario \u03c3 \u2264 15%), then the claimed w* is not optimal and the hypothesis is falsified.\n2) If, after reasonable parameter uncertainty and stress tests, the solution procedure cannot find any w with t* > 0 (i.e., no allocation achieves positive worst\u2011case real Sharpe) but an alternate, demonstrably implementable allocation (e.g., via weighted\u2011Sharpe or robust counterpart) yields strictly better worst\u2011case real Sharpe while respecting constraints, the minimax formulation claim fails.\n3) Over an ex\u2011post 10\u2011year realization matching one of the scenarios, if the real Sharpe of w* is materially below the modeled per\u2011scenario expected Sharpe (beyond stated uncertainty bounds), then modeling assumptions (\u03bc_s, Einfl_s, \u03a3_s) \u2014 and thus the formulation under those assumptions \u2014 are empirically rejected and must be revised.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Investor is single\u2011period static (no intra\u2011decadal rebalancing) and fully invests only in the three asset classes (TSE index funds, gold funds, fixed\u2011income funds).\n- No short selling; weights nonnegative; sum to 1.\n- Moderate risk tolerance encoded as per\u2011scenario annualized volatility cap \u03c3_cap = 15% (tunable).\n- Scenario definitions capture the economically relevant states (Status Quo, Conflict, Normalization) over the next 10 years; expected nominal returns, inflation, volatilities and correlations for each scenario are estimable and can be translated into real expected returns \u03bc_s_real and covariance \u03a3_s.\n- Asset returns are summarized adequately for this single\u2011period optimization by their scenario means and covariances (higher\u2011moment and tail effects can be incorporated via Sortino/CVaR variants or robust uncertainty sets if desired).\n- Solvers can reliably solve the SOC feasibility problems; numerical issues (RHS nonnegativity or infeasibility) will be diagnosed and reported.\n- Optional age\u2011informed box constraints reflect investor preferences and are applied only when explicitly chosen.\n\nIf this finalized formulation (real\u2011Sharpe maximin, SOC\u2011bisection, volatility cap, optional box bounds, and robust/sensitivity analyses) is accepted, the next step is to calibrate \u03bc_s_nominal, Einfl_s, \u03a3_s and r_nominal_s from recent TSE/gold/fixed\u2011income data plus expert adjustments and run the solver to produce the definitive static allocation w* and diagnostic outputs.",

If infeasible, switch to scenario\u2011weighted volatility cap or raise \u03c3_cap modestly (e.g., 17\u201320%) and re\u2011solve.\n- Sensitivity/robustness: sweep \u03bc_s \u00b110\u201320%, \u03a3_s scale \u00b110\u201330%, and vary \u03b5_s (ambiguity radius) to test allocation stability.\n\n5) Practical interpretation and expected structure of solution:\n- Given high nominal volatilities in Iran, the 15% worst\u2011case cap will typically force high fixed\u2011income and/or gold weights; gold will act as a crisis hedge in CE, fixed income will control volatility across SQ and DN, equities will be nonzero only to the extent they can improve worst\u2011case Sharpe without violating \u03c3_cap.\n- If no feasible w exists (common under extreme CE parameters), either relax \u03c3_cap, permit a small cash buffer outside the three assets, or switch to scenario\u2011weighted volatility constraint.\n\n6) Implementation checklist:\n- Calibrate scenario \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s and r_f_s from TSE history, local gold price series, and fixed\u2011income yields (complement with expert posterior for CE and DN).\n- Implement bisection + SOCP feasibility in CVXPY; run robustified version with ellipsoidal mean uncertainty.\n- Report w*, scenario Sharpe S_s(w*), \u03c3_s(w*), expected nominal returns, and tail metrics; present sensitivity tables.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable both computationally and empirically:\n- Computational falsification: If a different feasible weight vector w' satisfying all constraints yields a strictly higher minimum scenario Sharpe than w* (within numerical tolerance), the hypothesis (that w* as computed is optimal) is false.\n- Parameterization falsification: If, after rigorous local calibration (historical data + expert elicitation) and applying the identical optimization procedure, no feasible allocation exists under the 15% worst\u2011case volatility cap, then the hypothesis (existence of a feasible optimal static allocation under these parameters) is false.\n- Empirical falsification (ex\u2011post): Over the 10\u2011year horizon, simulate forward returns under the three scenario realizations (or observe realized regime outcomes). If the computed allocation consistently underperforms alternative constrained allocations on the minimum realized scenario Sharpe or violates the volatility cap in realized data, the practical validity is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- The investor holds a static allocation for 10 years with no interim rebalancing.\n- Only three asset classes are permitted: Tehran Stock Exchange index funds, domestic gold funds, domestic fixed\u2011income funds.\n- No short sales; weights are nonnegative and sum to 1.\n- Scenario parameterizations (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) capture the directional macroeconomic/geopolitical states and are calibrated reasonably from local data and expert views; initial illustrative values provided above.\n- Volatility cap is interpreted as annualized standard deviation and enforced in every scenario (worst\u2011case mode); cap default is 15% reflecting moderate risk tolerance for a 58\u2011year\u2011old investor.\n- Return distributions are adequately summarized by first and second moments for the SOCP approach; tail adjustments (CVaR or higher moments) are added if tails materially affect feasibility or preferences.\n- Robustness to parameter misspecification will be modeled via ellipsoidal uncertainty sets for expected returns (and optionally covariance), with radii chosen by expert elicitation or statistical confidence intervals.\n\nIf stakeholders agree to (A) worst\u2011case volatility cap = 15%, (B) adopt the illustrative scenario priors above as starting calibration, and (C) use the bisection+SOCP solver with ellipsoidal robustification and optional age\u2011appropriate floors, I endorse proceeding to compute w* numerically and produce the explicit static allocation and scenario performance tables.",

Produce sensitivity runs for variant floors/caps and uncertainty sets noted above. Optionally report real (inflation\u2011adjusted) Sharpe as a secondary experiment by subtracting scenario inflation from \u03bc and r_f.\n- Governance: present primary w* plus scenario-specific Sharpe/vol/return diagnostics and stress tables for CE tail risk.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable in two concrete ways:\n1) Computational falsification: If a different feasible allocation w' satisfying all stated constraints (w' \u2265 0, sum=1, per-scenario \u03c3 \u2264 15%, w'_FI \u2265 30%, w'_TSE \u2264 50%) yields a strictly larger worst-case nominal Sharpe than the reported w*, then the claim that w* maximizes the problem is false.\n2) Empirical falsification over the 10-year horizon: if the realized ex\u2011post minimum across the three realized scenario outcomes of the portfolio\u2019s annualized nominal Sharpe (computed on actual returns and realized volatilities in IRR) is consistently and materially lower than the model\u2019s ex\u2011ante worst-case Sharpe under reasonable updates to scenario identification/realizations, the model\u2019s predictive adequacy and practical recommendation are falsified (subject to declared input uncertainty).\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Nominal local\u2011currency (IRR) returns and yields are the relevant metric for the investor (primary Sharpe measured in nominal IRR terms).\n- The three scenario parameter sets (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) meaningfully summarize plausible 10\u2011year macro/regime outcomes in Iran; these are a working default and should be adjusted by domain experts if new information emerges.\n- Volatility cap of 15% annualized is appropriate for \u201cmoderate\u201d risk for a 58\u2011year\u2011old and must hold in every scenario to satisfy risk tolerance.\n- No short selling; fully invested; single-period static allocation held for 10 years (no interim rebalancing).\n- Robustness runs (\u03bc-ellipsoid \u03b4_\u03bc = 5%, \u03a3 inflation \u03b1 up to 0.2, FI floor variants) will accompany the primary result to quantify model risk.\n- SOC bisection solver finds global optimum under given convex formulation and given inputs.\n\nIf the group accepts nominal Sharpe as primary, per\u2011scenario vol cap 15%, FI floor 30%, TSE cap 50%, and \u03bc-uncertainty \u03b4_\u03bc = 5% for robustness runs, then the above specification is final and ready for execution to produce the single recommended static allocation and its sensitivity suite.",

Use excess returns (r_f = 0) convention for modeling clarity.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable. After selecting the proposed w* and holding it static for the 10\u2011year horizon:\n- If the realized macro path corresponds to one of the modeled scenarios and the realized annualized excess return and volatility of the portfolio produce a realized scenario Sharpe less than the model\u2019s worst\u2011case predicted t* by an amount exceeding estimation error bounds (and a different feasible static allocation respecting the same constraints would have produced a higher realized minimum Sharpe across realized scenario(s)), then the hypothesis is falsified.\n- More generally, if an alternative feasible static allocation (respecting the same constraints) empirically yields a higher realized minimum Sharpe across the actually observed scenario sequence (over the 10 years), then the claim that w* maximizes the minimum expected Sharpe under the stated inputs is falsified.\n- The model\u2019s input assumptions (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, uncertainty radii, per\u2011scenario vol cap, and box constraints) are explicit; divergence of realized regime statistics beyond these assumptions invalidates the applicability of the hypothesis rather than the mathematical solution.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. Scenario completeness: The three narratives (SQ, CE, DN) capture the relevant 10\u2011year macro\u2011regime outcomes for Iran; one of them or a weighted combination will be representative of realized conditions.\n2. Input realism: The supplied \u03bc_s and \u03a3_s (and their uncertainty bands) are credible priors for excess returns and risks under each scenario\u2014these numbers are replaceable but must be fixed for the optimization.\n3. Excess\u2011return convention: r_f_s = 0 (work in returns in excess of scenario short cash) to avoid nominal/real conversion ambiguity.\n4. Static horizon: No rebalancing over 10 years; a single static allocation is held throughout.\n5. Constraints: No shorting, weights sum to 1, per\u2011scenario volatility cap \u2264 15% enforced for all scenarios, and box constraints w_TSE \u2264 40%, w_fixed \u2265 30%, 10% \u2264 w_gold \u2264 40% reflect the investor\u2019s moderate risk tolerance.\n6. Tractability: Covariance matrices \u03a3_s are positive definite and numerical solvers reliably solve the SOCP feasibility problems arising in bisection.\n7. Robustness framing: Ellipsoidal uncertainty (||\u0394\u03bc_s||2 \u2264 0.025) and covariance inflation (CE +25%) sufficiently capture mean and tail uncertainty for sensitivity checks; larger unmodeled shocks may change optimal choices.\n\nIf the panel accepts these parameter choices and constraints, the SOCP+bisection procedure will produce the candidate optimal static allocation w* and its diagnostics; sensitivity analyses under the stated uncertainty sets will quantify robustness.",

Optionally add robust uncertainty sets on \u03bc_s and \u03a3_s (e.g., \u03bc_s \u2208 [\u03bc\u0302_s \u00b1 \u0394\u03bc], \u03a3_s in spectral norm ball) to produce a conservatively robust solution.\n\n2) Scenario parameter priors (real annual returns; used as the testing priors unless calibrated differently):\n- Status Quo (SQ):\n  - \u03bc_SQ = [Equity 6%, Gold 3%, Fixed  -2%]\n  - \u03c3 = [30%, 20%, 8%], \u03c1(E,G)=0.10, \u03c1(E,F)=0.00, \u03c1(G,F)=-0.10\n- Conflict Escalation (CE):\n  - \u03bc_CE = [Equity -30%, Gold 20%, Fixed -40%]\n  - \u03c3 = [60%, 40%, 30%], \u03c1(E,G)=-0.30, \u03c1(E,F)=-0.20, \u03c1(G,F)=-0.10\n- Diplomatic Normalization (DN):\n  - \u03bc_DN = [Equity 20%, Gold -5%, Fixed 5%]\n  - \u03c3 = [25%, 20%, 10%], \u03c1(E,G)=0.20, \u03c1(E,F)=0.10, \u03c1(G,F)=0.00\n- Real risk\u2011free baseline: r_real = 0% (Sharpe computed using real excess returns). These priors reflect the macro narratives and are open to calibration using local data.\n\n3) Robust and complementary features:\n- Optionally incorporate uncertainty sets for \u03bc_s (e.g., \u00b11\u20133% bands) and \u03a3_s (e.g., \u00b110% on volatility or correlation uncertainty) and require constraints to hold for all parameter draws (robust SOC formulation) \u2014 this reduces parameter\u2011sensitivity and is recommended given Iran\u2019s high uncertainty.\n- Tail\u2011risk adjustment: include an auxiliary CVaR constraint across scenario mixtures or enforce a lower bound on a stress quantile (e.g., one\u2011year 10th percentile) computed via scenario\u2011specific nonnormal tail parametric or Monte Carlo models.\n- Alternative objectives (for sensitivity): weighted scenario Sharpe maximization or mean\u2011variance formulations can be computed for comparison, but the primary test is the minimax\u2011Sharpe solution above.\n\n4) Practical steps to test:\n- Fix priors (above) or calibrate to local historical/forward data.\n- Implement solver routine (bisection on t; feasibility via SOC).\n- Report w*, achieved worst\u2011case Sharpe t*, per\u2011scenario returns, and scenario volatilities.\n- Compare sensitivity when relaxing/tightening bounds (e.g., equity cap 60% \u2192 50%, fixed floor 20% \u2192 25%) and when adding parametric uncertainty.\n\n5) Expected qualitative form of w* (to guide interpretation):\n- Due to CE\u2019s severe negative expected returns on equity and fixed income but positive on gold, the minimax objective with a 15% vol cap will bias toward gold and enforced fixed\u2011income floor, and limit equity exposure \u2014 hence the asserted direction wG \u2265 wE and wF \u2265 25%.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable: implement the specified optimization with the stated priors and constraints. If the computed optimal static allocation w* violates any of the claimed structural outcomes (for example, if wE > wG, or wF < 25%, or the solver finds that no feasible w exists under the 15% per\u2011scenario volatility cap), then the hypothesis is falsified. Additionally, if robustification (reasonable uncertainty bands) or small changes in plausible priors reverse the qualitative ordering (gold not overweight equity) or force infeasibility, the hypothesis is rejected. Numerical disagreement between the derived w* and the asserted direction (gold overweight, equity limited, fixed\u2011income floor) falsifies the prediction.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Decision horizon and rebalancing: single static allocation held for the full 10\u2011year horizon (no interim rebalancing).\n- Returns are measured in real terms (inflation adjusted); real risk\u2011free r = 0% for Sharpe computations across scenarios.\n- Scenario priors (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, correlations) are as listed unless replaced by calibrated local estimates; these priors encode the macro narratives of Status Quo, Conflict Escalation, and Diplomatic Normalization.\n- Volatility cap is applied per scenario: portfolio annualized \u03c3 \u2264 15% in each scenario, reflecting moderate risk tolerance of a 58\u2011year\u2011old investor.\n- Portfolio constraints: weights nonnegative, sum to 1, equity cap 50%, fixed\u2011income floor 25% (practical age\u2011based bounds).\n- No leverage or short selling allowed.\n- Minimax objective: maximize the minimum expected annualized Sharpe across the three scenarios (conservative/worst\u2011case focus).\n- Solvability: SOC convexity holds for the fixed\u2011parameter problem and suitable conic solvers are available to find w*.",

Similarly, changing scenario priors or tightening constraints (e.g., enforcing \u03c3_max for Conflict or lowering CVaR threshold) that lead to a materially different optimal w* demonstrates the dependence of the hypothesis on its explicit assumptions; if no feasible w exists under these constraints, the hypothesis (existence of a feasible optimal allocation) is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- The illustrative scenario priors (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s, correlations) approximate plausible 10\u2011year outcomes given Iran\u2019s macro/geopolitical states; domain experts can and should refine them before final computation.\n- Investor is moderate risk tolerant: enforce \u03c3_max = 15% for Status Quo and Normalization; allow higher Conflict volatility but cap tail loss via 95%\u2011CVaR \u2265 \u221260%.\n- No short sales and full investment (w_i \u2265 0, \u2211 w_i = 1).\n- Single\u2011period (static) allocation held for the 10\u2011year horizon (no interim rebalancing).\n- The max\u2011min Sharpe objective and SOCP/bisection solver formulation produce a reliable global optimum under convex feasibility at each bisection step; numerical robustness ensured by auxiliary variables and standard solvers (MOSEK/ECOS).\n- Tail behavior can be approximated sufficiently by sample\u2011based heavy\u2011tailed simulations for CVaR enforcement and validation.",

Expect w* to favor a durable fixed-income floor plus meaningful gold exposure as downside hedge; exact weights will depend on calibrated \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, and r_f_s.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable: re-calibrating scenario inputs (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) from independent, defensible local market data or applying an alternative but credible set of scenario parameterizations should produce the same optimal allocation w* under the same formal constraints. If a materially different allocation yields a strictly higher worst\u2011case Sharpe while satisfying all stated constraints under the identical inputs and solver procedure, this hypothesis is false. Empirically, if the realized 10\u2011yr outcomes across the realized regimes produce a minimum realized annualized Sharpe lower than that of an alternative feasible static allocation, the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Single-period static holding for 10 years; no interim rebalancing or contributions/withdrawals.\n- Asset proxies: broad Tehran Stock Exchange index fund, a domestic gold fund/spot gold proxy, and representative fixed\u2011income funds or short-term government bills/bonds.\n- Nominal returns, volatilities, correlations, and short rates are scenario-specific and reflect macro/geopolitical narratives; seeds above are starting values requiring calibration to local data and inflation expectations.\n- Volatility cap V_max = 15% enforced in every scenario (reflecting moderate risk tolerance for a 58\u2011y/o).\n- Retirement bounds: w_FI \u2265 20%, w_TSE \u2264 40%, w_Gold \u2264 60%; no short selling.\n- SOC/bisection approach is numerically reliable for 3 assets; CVaR tail computations use parametric or MC simulation with scenario-appropriate tail specifications.\n- Optional 95%-CVaR(10\u2011yr) \u2264 40% is treated as an additional robustness variant (to be imposed or reported per governance decisions).",

Solve for maximal t (the worst\u2011scenario Sharpe) by bisection or direct conic maximization.\n\nBaseline scenario parameter priors (annualized, to be calibrated locally \u2014 use as working baseline):\n- Status Quo (SQ): persistent sanctions, chronic inflation, economic drag\n    r_f_SQ = 22%; \u03bc_SQ = [TSE: 25%, Gold: 15%, FI: 22%]; \u03c3 = [30%, 22%, 12%]; Corr(TSE,Gold)=0.1, Corr(TSE,FI)=0.2, Corr(Gold,FI)=0.0.\n- Conflict Escalation (CE): direct conflict, hyperinflation, severe equity crash\n    r_f_CE = 60%; \u03bc_CE = [TSE: \u221240%, Gold: 80%, FI: 20%]; \u03c3 = [60%, 35%, 30%]; Corr(TSE,Gold)=\u22120.3, Corr(TSE,FI)=0.4, Corr(Gold,FI)=\u22120.2.\n- Diplomatic Normalization (DN): sanctions relief, stabilization, growth\n    r_f_DN = 12%; \u03bc_DN = [TSE: 35%, Gold: 5%, FI: 12%]; \u03c3 = [25%, 18%, 10%]; Corr(TSE,Gold)=0.0, Corr(TSE,FI)=0.3, Corr(Gold,FI)=0.0.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Use \u03a3_s built from \u03c3_s and Corr matrix. For each candidate w and t, the constraint w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t\u00b7sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w) is an SOC constraint after introducing auxiliary variables.\n- Perform robust checks: (i) \u03bc uncertainty sets (ellipsoidal \u00b12\u20135%), (ii) covariance scaling (1.0\u20131.5) and heavy tails (t\u2011distributed draws, df\u22485) for stress tests, (iii) sensitivity to V_max (12% and 18%) and to the w_FI floor (no floor / 25% / 50%).\n- Produce both the constrained run (w_FI \u2265 35%) and unconstrained baseline for comparison; report SR_s(w), portfolio vol by scenario, and worst\u2011case SR (t*).\n- Diagnostics: if the problem is infeasible under the per\u2011scenario V_max = 15% (likely if CE vol priors are extremely high), then either (A) relax the per\u2011scenario cap to apply only to SQ and DN and allow a higher cap in CE (e.g., 20\u201325%), or (B) revisit and calibrate priors (especially \u03a3_CE and FI volatility) to local market data and realistic shock bounds.\n\nRationale and expected shape:\n- Conflict Escalation creates high TSE volatility and a negative expected equity return; thus the minimax Sharpe solution will reduce TSE exposure and increase FI and gold to preserve worst\u2011case Sharpe while meeting the moderate\u2011volatility objective.\n- Gold serves as conditional hedge (positive expected return and negative/low correlation in CE), while fixed income supplies income and lower nominal volatility in benign regimes \u2014 hence FI floor and dominance in the result.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable in several testable ways:\n- Numerical refutation: If, after calibrating \u03a3_s and \u03bc_s to credible local data and solving the stated SOCP exactly, the resulting optimal static allocation falls outside the proposed ranges (w_FI \u2209 [0.40,0.60] or w_Gold \u2209 [0.15,0.35] or w_TSE \u2209 [0.05,0.25]) while still satisfying the per\u2011scenario V_max = 15% and w_FI \u2265 35%, the hypothesis is falsified.\n- Feasibility refutation: If the stated constraints (notably the per\u2011scenario 15% volatility cap applied to CE with the baseline priors) are infeasible and no realistic recalibration of priors (within domain\u2011plausible bounds) makes the problem feasible, the hypothesis (as stated, including the per\u2011scenario cap) is falsified and must be revised to relax the cap or change priors.\n- Out\u2011of\u2011sample fail: Over the realized 10\u2011year horizon, if the chosen static allocation yields realized worst\u2011scenario Sharpe materially below the model\u2019s predicted worst\u2011case Sharpe (after accounting for estimation error and transaction costs), and this shortfall cannot be explained by tail events beyond assumed stress bounds, then the hypothesis is empirically falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. Scenario narratives and baseline priors (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) reasonably represent plausible 10\u2011year outcomes for Iran; these priors will be calibrated to IRR\u2011denominated data where possible.\n2. Single\u2011period static allocation held for 10 years (no interim rebalancing or contributions/withdrawals).\n3. Nonnegativity (no short selling) and fully invested constraint (weights sum to 1).\n4. Volatility cap V_max = 15% is applied per scenario (conservative posture for age 58); feasibility contingent on priors.\n5. Fixed\u2011income floor w_FI \u2265 35% reflects income and liquidity needs for the 58\u2011year\u2011old investor.\n6. Market frictions (transaction costs, taxes, liquidity constraints) are secondary and can be layered post\u2011optimization; returns are nominal and measured in IRR.\n7. Covariances and returns are reasonably stationary within each scenario for the 10\u2011year horizon (i.e., scenario parameters summarize the distribution over the decade).\n\nNext computational step (if the panel accepts): run the SOCP described above with the baseline priors and constraints (V_max = 15% per scenario; w_FI \u2265 35%) and report the precise optimal weights, per\u2011scenario Sharpe and vol, and sensitivity analyses. If infeasible, report the minimal relaxation required (which constraint and by how much) to restore feasibility.",

The approach yields closed-form correction terms (low-order) that capture impacts of local and stochastic volatility components.",
      "limitations": "Results rely on small-parameter asymptotics and continuous-time model assumptions; accuracy may degrade for large volatility shocks or rapid regime changes (e.g., sudden geopolitical shocks). The framework omits practical constraints such as transaction costs, discretely traded rebalancing, liquidity limits, and explicit modeling of three distinct asset classes (TSE index funds, gold funds, fixed-income). Calibration to Iranian-market data and scenario-specific stress (hyperinflation, sanctions) may be challenging and can violate asymptotic assumptions.",

The system currently has zero hypotheses and zero diversity (total_hypotheses = 0; hypothesis_diversity = 0.0), so seeding a sufficiently large and diverse set of candidate hypotheses is essential. Because the project is in an exploratory phase and diversity is nil, 'debate' mode is chosen to produce adversarially refined, higher-quality, and diverse hypothesis candidates. Quantity = 12 provides a broad initial idea pool for subsequent review and refinement; debate_max_turns = 6 gives enough adversarial exchange to stress-test and diversify proposals.",

    "research_goal": "To determine the optimal static asset allocation between Tehran Stock Exchange index funds, gold funds, and fixed-income funds for a 58-year-old Iranian investor by developing a robust portfolio optimization model. This model will identify the specific asset weights that maximize the portfolio's minimum expected Sharpe Ratio across three forward-looking, 10-year scenarios derived from Iran's current conditions:\n\n1.  **Status Quo:** Modeled with persistent international sanctions, chronic domestic inflation, and economic drag from infrastructure crises like water and electricity imbalances.\n2.  **Conflict Escalation:** Modeled with the geopolitical shock of a direct military conflict, resulting in hyperinflation and a severe equity market downturn.\n3.  **Diplomatic Normalization:** Modeled with the positive economic shock of successful negotiations, leading to sanctions relief and market stabilization.\n\nThe optimization will be quantitatively constrained to reflect a \"moderate risk tolerance\" by ensuring the resulting portfolio's annualized volatility does not exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., 15%).",
    "strategic_context": "This generation step seeds the research pipeline with a diverse set of candidate portfolio models and allocation hypotheses tailored to the three Iran-specific scenarios and the 15% volatility constraint. Creating a robust initial idea pool is necessary before reviews, ranking, and targeted literature searches can effectively guide model selection and refinement. The generated hypotheses will enable immediate downstream tasks (review, reflect, rank, and later evolution or literature retrieval after cooldown), accelerating progress from exploratory phase toward a validated, robust static allocation recommendation for the investor."
