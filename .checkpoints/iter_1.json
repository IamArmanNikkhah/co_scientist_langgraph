Data-driven statistical and computational analyses will be used to identify the stimulus and response features most sensitive and specific to early cognitive decline, with diagnostic accuracy evaluated against established cognitive assessments (e.g., MoCA, CDR).\nPrimary objective: Define the key VR content and sensory features that elicit measurable cognitive signatures and establish a set of multimodal digital biomarkers (behavioral + neural) for early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s-related impairment.",

Data-driven statistical and computational analyses will be used to identify the stimulus and response features most sensitive and specific to early cognitive decline, with diagnostic accuracy evaluated against established cognitive assessments (e.g., MoCA, CDR).\nPrimary objective: Define the key VR content and sensory features that elicit measurable cognitive signatures and establish a set of multimodal digital biomarkers (behavioral + neural) for early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s-related impairment.",
