    "research_goal": "To determine the optimal static asset allocation between Tehran Stock Exchange index funds, gold funds, and fixed-income funds for a 58-year-old Iranian investor by developing a robust portfolio optimization model. This model will identify the specific asset weights that maximize the portfolio's minimum expected Sharpe Ratio across three forward-looking, 10-year scenarios derived from Iran's current conditions:\n\n1.  **Status Quo:** Modeled with persistent international sanctions, chronic domestic inflation, and economic drag from infrastructure crises like water and electricity imbalances.\n2.  **Conflict Escalation:** Modeled with the geopolitical shock of a direct military conflict, resulting in hyperinflation and a severe equity market downturn.\n3.  **Diplomatic Normalization:** Modeled with the positive economic shock of successful negotiations, leading to sanctions relief and market stabilization.\n\nThe optimization will be quantitatively constrained to reflect a \"moderate risk tolerance\" by ensuring the resulting portfolio's annualized volatility does not exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., 15%).",
    "strategic_context": "This literature retrieval seeds the entire project by supplying methodological templates, empirical parameter estimates, scenario-construction approaches, and domain knowledge about Iranian assets\u2014information essential to generate the first set of hypotheses (candidate static allocations), to design realistic scenario return/covariance inputs, and to select appropriate robust optimization solvers and constraints. The results will enable subsequent tasks: generating candidate allocations, evolving and refining models (e.g., selecting between minimax Sharpe, distributionally robust formulations, or Black-Litterman adaptations), and ultimately producing a constrained portfolio that maximizes the minimum expected Sharpe Ratio across the three 10-year scenarios while respecting the investor's volatility cap and moderate risk tolerance."
