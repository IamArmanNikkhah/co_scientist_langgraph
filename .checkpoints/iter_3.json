Portfolio vol \u03c3_s(w) = sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w).\n- Decision problem (SOCP):\n  maximize t\n  subject to \u2200 s: w' u_s \u2265 t \u00b7 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w||        (Sharpe_s \u2265 t)\n               ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| \u2264 \u03c3_cap               (vol cap, \u03c3_cap = 0.15)\n               1' w = 1, w \u2265 0\n- The constraints w' u_s \u2265 t \u00b7 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| are second\u2011order cone constraints; the program is an SOCP solvable by standard solvers (ECOS, MOSEK, SCS) and convex\u2011optimization toolkits (CVX, CVXPY).\n- Baseline scenario parameterization (Expert A\u2019s recommended numerical inputs \u2014 all figures annualized excess returns and stdevs):\n  - Status Quo (SQ): u_SQ = [0.06, 0.08, 0.03]; \u03c3 = [0.35, 0.20, 0.10]; \u03c1_TG=0.20, \u03c1_TF=0.10, \u03c1_GF=0.00.\n  - Conflict Escalation (CE): u_CE = [\u22120.25, 0.30, \u22120.10]; \u03c3 = [0.60, 0.40, 0.30]; \u03c1_TG=\u22120.20, \u03c1_TF=0.60, \u03c1_GF=\u22120.30.\n  - Diplomatic Normalization (DN): u_DN = [0.30, 0.10, 0.05]; \u03c3 = [0.25, 0.15, 0.08]; \u03c1_TG=0.10, \u03c1_TF=0.20, \u03c1_GF=0.00.\n  - Construct \u03a3_s from \u03c3 and \u03c1 in the standard way.\n- Rationale for the proposed point allocation:\n  - Conflict scenario produces deep negative equity returns and high equity volatility while making gold relatively attractive as a hedge \u2192 optimizer favors gold to raise worst\u2011case Sharpe.\n  - Fixed income provides lower volatility ballast and positive floor to satisfy the \u03c3_cap and raise worst\u2011case Sharpe under status quo and normalization.\n  - Equities are limited (20%) to capture upside in normalization but constrained to prevent extreme downside under conflict.\n- Robustness and validation steps to test/falsify:\n  - Solve the SOCP exactly with the listed u_s and \u03a3_s to compute the true maximizing w* and worst\u2011case Sharpe t*.\n  - Sensitivity checks: \u00b120% perturbations to u_s, alternative \u03c3_cap values (10\u201318%), and adding ellipsoidal uncertainty sets on u_s or \u03a3_s (robust SOCP) to confirm allocation stability.\n  - Alternative objectives to compare: maximize worst\u2011case Sortino, or add CVaR bounds for tail protection.\n- Practical implementation notes: enforce operational floors/ceilings if required (e.g., min FI \u2265 10% or max TSE \u2264 60%) as linear constraints in the SOCP. Use annualized returns and covariances consistent with local currency inflation indexing (use real or excess returns over a locally relevant short\u2011term cash proxy).\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable by explicitly solving the stated SOCP with the specified scenario parameterization and volatility cap. If the SOCP produces a different allocation w\u0302 that yields a strictly larger minimum annualized Sharpe Ratio across the three scenarios than the proposed w* = [0.20, 0.45, 0.35], or if w* violates any feasibility constraint (weights sum to 1, nonnegativity, vol cap per scenario), then the hypothesis is falsified. Likewise, if sensitivity/robustness analyses (\u00b120% parameter perturbations or ellipsoidal uncertainty) yield consistent allocations materially different from w* (beyond practical tolerance), the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. The three scenarios (SQ, CE, DN) and their numeric parameterizations (u_s, \u03a3_s) adequately capture the relevant 10\u2011year Iran macro/geopolitical outcomes and are the correct inputs for the investor\u2019s subjective beliefs.\n2. Excess returns (\u03bc \u2212 rf) are the appropriate return metric for Sharpe computation; local short\u2011term cash proxy chosen for excess returns is well\u2011defined even under inflation.\n3. A single static (no\u2011rebalance) allocation over the full 10\u2011year horizon is appropriate for this investor\u2019s objectives and constraints.\n4. Volatility is measured as annualized standard deviation from the scenario covariance matrices and must not exceed \u03c3_cap = 0.15 in each scenario.\n5. No short selling is allowed; only the three asset classes may be held.\n6. Second\u2011order cone formulation is numerically well\u2011posed given \u03a3_s positive definiteness (apply shrinkage if needed).\n7. Behavioral/regulatory constraints (taxes, illiquidity of some funds) are either negligible or can be represented later by simple linear constraints.\n\nI accept option A (use the SOCP minimax\u2011Sharpe formulation and the numeric scenario point estimates as the baseline) for final computation and reporting.",

Framing the investor\u2019s allocation problem as a minimax (worst\u2011case) Sharpe optimization across three Iran\u2011specific scenarios captures the precautionary objective appropriate for a 58\u2011year\u2011old with moderate risk tolerance. The modeling choices are explicit: three asset buckets (TSE / Gold / Fixed Income), per\u2011scenario expected excess returns and covariances, nonnegativity and budget constraints, and a per\u2011scenario annualized volatility cap (15%). The constraint form w' u_s \u2265 t ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| correctly encodes the requirement that the portfolio Sharpe in scenario s be at least t. That structure is amenable to modern convex\u2011optimization tooling: the worst\u2011case Sharpe objective is quasi\u2011convex and can be solved reliably via a sequence of SOC feasibility problems (bisection on t) or using a homogenization that casts scenario constraints in SOC form for a fixed t. The scenario parameterization is plausible: Conflict Escalation has very negative equity returns and high equity volatility with gold appreciating and acting as hedge; normalization reverses that. Intuitively this pushes the optimizer toward a relatively gold\u2011tilted, conservative portfolio with material fixed income to hold down volatility \u2014 consistent with the reported candidate [0.20, 0.45, 0.35]. The hypothesis is falsifiable in a straightforward computational way (solve the stated SOCP and compare best feasible w to the candidate), and the authors provide sensible robustness checks (\u00b120% perturbations, different \u03c3_caps, ellipsoidal uncertainty, CVaR alternatives).\n\nSkeptic:\nA detailed arithmetic check shows the nominal candidate allocation w* = [0.20,0.45,0.35] is infeasible under the explicit per\u2011scenario volatility cap stated (\u03c3_cap = 0.15) in at least one scenario. Using the Conflict Escalation inputs (\u03c3 = [0.60,0.40,0.30], \u03c1_{TG} = \u22120.20, \u03c1_{TF} = 0.60, \u03c1_{GF} = \u22120.30) and constructing \u03a3_CE in the usual way, the portfolio variance for w* evaluates to approximately 0.05297, implying \u03c3_CE \u2248 0.230 (\u224823.0% annualized), which violates the per\u2011scenario 15% cap by a large margin. Status Quo and Diplomatic Normalization scenarios produce \u03c3_SQ \u2248 13.1% and \u03c3_DN \u2248 9.5%, both within the cap, so conflict is the binding scenario \u2014 exactly the intuition the designer invoked \u2014 but the candidate allocation does not meet the declared feasibility constraint. Because feasibility is a hard requirement, the declared w* cannot be the solution of the constrained optimization as specified. \n\nBeyond this concrete falsification, there are additional concerns: (1) the mathematical claim that the entire problem is an SOCP needs a precise statement. Maximizing the minimum of ratios \u03bc_s' w / sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) is quasi\u2011convex; a common practical approach is parametric SOC feasibility (fix t and test ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| \u2264 (1/t) \u03bc_s' w, which for fixed t is an SOC constraint of the form ||A w|| \u2264 b^T w provided b^T w \u2265 0). That means most solvers can find t* via bisection / line search over t with SOC feasibility checks. But the original mixed (w,t) formulation is not an immediate standard convex program in (w,t) without that parametric trick or a careful homogenization. (2) Important real\u2011world effects are not fully handled: local currency inflation, real vs nominal excess returns, FX and repatriation risk, sanctions/regulatory constraints and fund access, liquidity of TSE and gold funds, taxation, and practical implementability for an Iranian investor (custody and settlement risks). (3) Tail risk beyond variance (as the authors note) may be material in conflict states; relying solely on second\u2011moment limits can understate downside if returns are heavy\u2011tailed. (4) Single\u2011period, no\u2011rebalance assumption may be unrealistic for a 10\u2011year horizon and for an investor nearing retirement; lifecycle and sequence\u2011of\u2011returns risk matter.\n\nSynthesis and Verdict:\n- The methodology (minimax Sharpe objective across explicit scenarios) is appropriate and operationally valuable; the modeling choices are transparent and the hypothesis is precisely falsifiable. The proposal offers a good workflow to produce defensible conservative allocations for a geopolitically stressed market.\n- However, the specific numeric claim that w* = [0.20, 0.45, 0.35] satisfies all constraints and is the optimizer is false: it violates the stated per\u2011scenario volatility cap in the Conflict Escalation scenario (\u03c3_CE \u2248 23% >> 15%). Therefore the hypothesis as stated is disproved.\n\nActionable next steps (practical, prioritized):\n1) Run the correct optimization: implement a parametric SOC feasibility routine (bisection on t) or homogenized SOCP to find the true maximizer w\u0302 and worst\u2011case t\u0302 under the specified scenarios and constraints. This will produce the definitive test of the hypothesis and the true worst\u2011case Sharpe. (I can provide CVXPY/ECOS code skeleton.)\n2) Enforce per\u2011scenario \u03c3_cap during solving and examine whether the conflict scenario is binding; if infeasible at target \u03c3_cap, relax \u03c3_cap stepwise (e.g., test 10\u201318%) or add operational floors (min FI \u2265 X) to find feasible conservative solutions.\n3) Add realistic adjustments before deployment: convert returns and covariances to real (inflation\u2011adjusted) excess returns using a local short\u2011term cash proxy; explicitly model FX and repatriation constraints; include liquidity and regulatory feasibility (can the investor buy the proposed instruments?).\n4) Augment risk metrics: run CVaR or tail\u2011risk constraints (or include downside semicovariance) and perform Monte Carlo with fat\u2011tailed scenario draws to confirm that variance\u2011based Sharpe is not misleadingly optimistic in tails.\n5) Sensitivity and robustification: \u00b120% parameter sweeps, ellipsoidal or box uncertainty sets on \u03bc and \u03a3, and robust SOCP variants to see if allocation structure (gold tilt, reduced equity) is stable.\n6) Operational recommendation for the candidate: because conflict volatility is dominant, expect the optimizer to push equity down further (below 20%) and shift weight to fixed\u2011income and gold (but gold alone may not lower volatility because it can be volatile itself); only a computational solve will quantify the tradeoffs correctly.\n\nMeta note: to improve grounding for regime calibrations and to address practical implementability for an Iranian investor, please provide local data or allow a literature file (use --literature-file) covering TSE historical returns, local inflation series, tradability of gold funds, and fixed\u2011income instrument availability in Iran.\n\nConclusion: The conceptual framework is sound and the approach is testable. The specific numerical claim w* = [0.20, 0.45, 0.35] is falsified because it violates the stated per\u2011scenario volatility cap (Conflict Escalation). Recompute the SOCP (via parametric SOC feasibility or direct homogenization) with the provided inputs and follow the robustness checks listed to produce the actual optimal conservative allocation."

Robust variants incorporate box uncertainty on expected returns (\u00b13 percentage points) and a +10% covariance scaling sensitivity; the optimal solution is found by bisection on the worst\u2011case Sharpe and SOCP feasibility checks.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nObjective (minimax Sharpe, nominal):\n- Let w \u2208 R^3 be weights [w_TSE, w_Gold, w_FI], w \u2265 0, 1\u2032w = 1.\n- For each scenario s \u2208 {Status, Conflict, Normal}, let \u03bc_s \u2208 R^3 be annual nominal expected returns, \u03a3_s \u2208 R^{3\u00d73} the annual covariance matrix, and r_f,s the annual nominal short\u2011term yield.\n- Define Sharpe_s(w) = (w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s) / sqrt(w\u2032\u03a3_s w).\n- Maximize t subject to Sharpe_s(w) \u2265 t for all s.\n\nMathematical program (SOC\u2011representable for fixed t \u2014 solved by bisection on t):\nmaximize t\nsubject to, \u2200 s:\n  w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s \u2265 t \u00b7 sqrt(w\u2032\u03a3_s w)\nsum_i w_i = 1\nw_i \u2208 [lb_i, ub_i] (no shorting)\nsqrt(w\u2032\u03a3_Status w) \u2264 0.15  (primary volatility cap on Status Quo)\nIf infeasible, one\u2011time relax cap \u2192 0.18 and re\u2011solve.\n\nRecommended hard bounds (life\u2011stage / moderate risk):\n- w_TSE \u2208 [0.15, 0.60]\n- w_Gold \u2208 [0.00, 0.35]\n- w_FI \u2208 [0.25, 0.70]\n\nScenario parameterization (nominal annual; starting inputs for optimization \u2014 to be adjusted by expert elicitation if desired):\n- Status Quo: \u03bc = [TSE +18%, Gold +15%, FI +22%]; \u03c3 = [40%, 25%, 12%]; \u03c1(TSE,Gold)=+0.1, \u03c1(TSE,FI)=+0.2, \u03c1(Gold,FI)=0.0; r_f = 20%.\n- Conflict Escalation: \u03bc = [TSE \u221230%, Gold +50%, FI +60%]; \u03c3 = [70%, 40%, 30%]; \u03c1(TSE,Gold)=\u22120.3, \u03c1(TSE,FI)=0.0, \u03c1(Gold,FI)=+0.15; r_f = 50% (nominal).\n- Diplomatic Normalization: \u03bc = [TSE +40%, Gold +5%, FI +20%]; \u03c3 = [30%, 20%, 10%]; \u03c1(TSE,Gold)=0.0, \u03c1(TSE,FI)=+0.3, \u03c1(Gold,FI)=0.0; r_f = 10%.\n\nRobustness and sensitivity:\n- Nominal Sharpe optimization is primary. Also run a robust variant: worst\u2011case \u03bc_s within box \u03bc_s \u00b1 3 percentage points (\u00b13ppt) and covariance sensitivity scaling up to +10% (\u03a3_s \u2190 (1+\u03b4)\u03a3_s, \u03b4 \u2208 [0,0.10]). Solve minimax over scenarios and \u03bc\u2011ambiguity by evaluating constraints at worst\u2011case \u03bc in the box (finite worst\u2011case obtained by solving the inner minimization or by enumerating extreme points).\n- Compare bench allocations: (A) scenario\u2011weighted Sharpe optimizer (weights \u03b1_s, e.g., \u03b1 = [0.6,0.2,0.2]), (B) Black\u2013Litterman posterior blending the three views equally, and (C) conventional mean\u2011variance under same volatility cap.\n- Solver & numerical recipe: use CVXPY + MOSEK (or ECOS); implement outer bisection on t (tolerance 1e\u20113). For each t, solve SOC feasibility: linear constraints + SOC constraints (w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s \u2265 t\u00b7||L_s w||_2 where L_s is Cholesky of \u03a3_s) + volatility cap SOC.\n\nDeliverables to validate/compute:\n- Final static weights w*, achieved worst\u2011case annualized Sharpe t*.\n- Per\u2011scenario portfolio nominal expected returns, volatilities, and Sharpe ratios.\n- 10\u2011year nominal cumulative return projections per scenario (compounded).\n- Sensitivity reports: \u03bc \u00b13ppt worst case, \u03a3 +10% scaling, and one fallback run with volatility cap = 18% if primary infeasible.\n- Comparative allocations (scenario\u2011weighted and BL) and their worst\u2011case Sharpe metrics.\n\nPractical notes:\n- All returns and r_f are nominal. A real\u2011return sensitivity (using inflation expectations per scenario) should be reported subsequently.\n- The Status Quo volatility cap (15%) is chosen as the moderate\u2011risk constraint reflecting a 58\u2011year\u2011old preference for capital preservation while allowing growth. The one\u2011time 18% relaxation preserves feasibility without materially altering the robustness philosophy.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable: compute w* from the above procedure and record predicted worst\u2011case nominal annualized Sharpe t*. Over the 10\u2011year hold, compare realized scenario outcomes (mapped to the nearest scenario by observed macro variables). If the realized worst\u2011case annualized Sharpe experienced by w* across the realized scenarios is systematically and materially below the predicted t* (statistically significant shortfall given model uncertainty and sensitivities), or if alternative feasible static allocations (within the same bounds and volatility cap) produce a higher realized worst\u2011case Sharpe ex\u2011post, then the hypothesis is rejected. Additionally, if the optimization is infeasible under agreed constraints even after the single fallback relaxation, the assumption set is internally inconsistent and the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. Scenario definitions and numeric parameterizations (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f,s) reasonably represent plausible 10\u2011year Iran macro paths (Status Quo, Conflict, Normalization). These are inputs subject to expert refinement.\n2. Nominal return modeling is appropriate for investor decisions; inflation expectations and real\u2011return adjustments are treated in sensitivity analysis, not in the primary run.\n3.

The objective \u2014 maximizing the minimum nominal Sharpe across scenarios \u2014 directly targets a risk\u2011adjusted, conservative performance metric that is intuitively aligned with a moderate\u2011risk, near\u2011retirement investor. The formulation is computationally tractable: for any fixed candidate Sharpe level t the constraints w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s \u2265 t\u00b7sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w) are second\u2011order\u2011cone (SOC) representable (linear left side \u2265 scalar \u00d7 Euclidean norm of L_s w), so an outer bisection on t with repeated convex SOC feasibility solves (CVXPY + MOSEK/ECOS) yields a reliable numerical approach. The inclusion of (i) box uncertainty on \u03bc (\u00b13ppt) and (ii) covariance scaling (+10%) is a pragmatic robustness layer; enumerating extreme points of the \u03bc\u2011box or solving an inner minimization gives a finite worst\u2011case handle for the minimax objective. The deliverable list (weights, per\u2011scenario returns/vols/Sharpe, 10\u2011yr cumulative projections, sensitivity reports, and comparisons to scenario\u2011weighted/Black\u2013Litterman/MV benches) is complete and actionable for decision\u2011makers and enables clear ex\u2011post falsification tests.\n\nSkeptic:\nSeveral domain and implementation issues materially weaken confidence in the hypothesis as currently specified. Most saliently the numeric scenario parameters (\u03bc_s, r_f,s) are extremely large in nominal terms (e.g., r_f,s = 20\u201350% and FI \u03bc in the 20\u201360% range). That scale is plausible in hyper/inflationary or very high\u2011rate environments but must be explicitly tied to consistent inflation and currency expectations for a 10\u2011year horizon. Using nominal short\u2011term yields as the long\u2011horizon \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d comparator is problematic: high nominal r_f driven by inflation or term premia will distort the Sharpe numerator and make the metric less informative for a long\u2011term investor without explicit real\u2011return adjustments. The Sharpe ratio also assumes that first and second moments capture decision\u2011relevant risk; with the extreme tail and regime shifts embodied in the scenarios, higher moments, skewness, and tail risk (e.g., CVaR or drawdown) may be decisive for a 58\u2011year\u2011old investor. The \u00b13ppt box around \u03bc may be small relative to the absolute levels and to the volatility (\u03c3 = 30\u201370%): worst\u2011case shifts in expected return directionally matter, but tail risk and model misspecification are not fully captured by a small additive box and a +10% \u03a3 scaling. Practical implementation constraints in Iran (capital controls, availability of investable TSE index funds or foreign\u2011currency gold instruments, liquidity, taxation, and currency hedging costs) are not modeled but can cause the computed w* to be infeasible or suboptimal in practice. The fallback rule (single one\u2011time relaxation from 15%\u219218%) is arbitrary and may hide an infeasibility/identification problem; feasibility should be analyzed more systematically. Finally, the optimization as written is nonconvex in (w,t) but the suggested bisection approach is correct only if feasibility for fixed t is solved robustly and numerical safeguards exist (\u03a3 positive\u2011definite, no near\u2011zero denominators, and sign checks on w'\u03bc \u2212 r_f), which must be enforced in implementation.\n\nTechnical correctness and SOC representability:\n- For fixed scalar t the constraint w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f,s \u2265 t\u00b7sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w) is convex (linear \u2265 scalar \u00d7 norm) and can be encoded as an SOC constraint using L_s (Cholesky factor) with ||L_s w||_2 on the right. Thus each feasibility problem is a convex SOC program. Using bisection over t (outer loop) is a standard and correct approach to recover the maximum feasible t to tolerance. - Caveats: the feasibility problem can be trivially infeasible if for any scenario the maximum possible excess return under the weight bounds is \u2264 0 or less than t times any lower bound on volatility; a pre\u2011check computing the maximal per\u2011scenario Sharpe (or the maximal achievable excess return and minimal achievable volatility) is advised to set sane initial bisection brackets. - Numerical issues to guard: ensure \u03a3_s are PD (add tiny jitter if necessary), ensure L_s exists and condition numbers are reasonable, bound t search interval, prevent division by zero or tiny denominators when volatility near zero.\n\nScenario parameterization and economic consistency:\n- The scenarios are extreme but plausible qualitatively: Conflict Escalation with TSE collapse and flight to gold/fixed income; Normalization with TSE boom, etc. However the numeric values must be grounded in macro expectations: nominal \u03bc and r_f must be consistent with inflation expectations and term structure. For example, if r_f = 50% nominal in Conflict, expressing a 10\u2011year nominal cumulative projection without adjusting for expected inflation will mislead an investor evaluating purchasing power. Recommendation: report real\u2011return versions using scenario inflation paths and supply per\u2011scenario term structures rather than a single short\u2011term r_f for the 10\u2011year horizon.\n\nInvestor suitability and constraint design:\n- The life\u2011stage bounds are explicit and defensible (min equity 15%, min FI 25%) but may not align with a 58\u2011year\u2011old who prioritizes capital preservation in a high\u2011volatility market; consider raising min FI or lowering max TSE for more conservative profiles. - The 15% annualized portfolio volatility cap measured under Status Quo is a sensible numerical proxy for risk tolerance but must be tested: if Status Quo \u03c3s are themselves large (TSE 40% etc.), the cap could meaningfully restrict equity exposure; document which constraint is binding in solutions. - The single fallback to 18% is pragmatic but arbitrary; better to present a feasibility boundary curve (t* as a function of allowed vol cap) and show incremental tradeoffs.\n\nRobustness and omitted risks:\n- The \u03bc \u00b13ppt box may understate model uncertainty, especially under regime changes; consider multiplicative uncertainty (\u00b1x% of \u03bc) or stochastic ambiguity models. - Heavy tails and non\u2011Gaussian behavior are important for extreme Iran\u2011specific events; consider adding CVaR constraints (tail risk), worst\u2011case low\u2011quantile returns, or stress tests beyond second\u2011moment scaling. - Currency and liquidity risks, transaction costs, taxes, and investability constraints (can the investor access TSE funds, currency convertibility for gold, credible FI funds) must be explicitly checked and modeled if material.\n\nFalsifiability and evaluation protocol:\n- The proposed falsifiability condition (compare realized worst\u2011case Sharpe ex\u2011post) is conceptually sound but operationally tricky: mapping realized macro paths to the nominal scenarios requires clear rule\u2011based classification and treatment of partial matches. Statistical tests for \u201csystematically and materially below predicted t*\u201d should incorporate model error bands generated from the sensitivity analysis (\u03bc box, \u03a3 scaling) and sampling uncertainty. - Suggest complementing the ex\u2011post test with rolling historical backtests under historical analogues (e.g., past Iranian episodes or comparable emerging market crises) and Monte Carlo simulations under heavy\u2011tailed return processes to quantify the distribution of realized Sharpe shortfalls under model uncertainty.\n\nSynthesis and prioritized recommendations (practical next steps):\n1) Validate and ground scenario numeric inputs: produce a short literature/file linking the nominal \u03bc and r_f values to inflation and yield data or expert elicitation. If you can provide observed TSE, gold, and FI historical nominal returns and short\u2011term yields for calibration, that will materially improve credibility. 2) Convert to real\u2011return reporting by adding scenario inflation paths; present both nominal and real worst\u2011case Sharpe to aid investor decisions. 3) Implement technical safeguards in the solver: (a) precompute per\u2011scenario max excess return and min volatility bounds to set bisection bracket, (b) ensure \u03a3 PD with jitter, (c) verify feasibility across weight bounds before bisection, (d) add solver tolerances and condition\u2011number checks. 4) Expand robustness checks: widen \u03bc uncertainty (consider \u00b15\u201310ppt or multiplicative), test CVaR(95/99) tail metrics, and produce t*(vol_cap) curve instead of a single fallback. 5) Explicitly test implementability: verify investability of TSE index funds and gold instruments for an Iranian 58\u2011year\u2011old (capital controls, custody, currency hedging, taxation), and if necessary add constraints that model these frictions. 6) Replace or augment Sharpe with tail\u2011sensitive objectives if heavy tails are confirmed (minimax of CVaR or maximize the worst\u2011case Sortino ratio). 7) Document mapping rules for ex\u2011post scenario classification and a statistical test plan for falsification that accounts for model uncertainty. 8) Provide the requested literature file (use the --literature-file flag) to ground \u03bc/\u03a3/r_f choices and to benchmark the \u00b13ppt uncertainty choices against empirical estimates.\n\nConclusion:\nThe hypothesis is methodologically sound as a mathematical/programmatic construction and is attractive for producing a single robust static allocation. Its practical validity hinges on grounding the scenario parameterization, addressing nominal vs. real return issues, capturing heavy tails and currency/investability frictions, and broadening the robustness envelope. If those missing pieces are addressed, the Minimax\u2011Sharpe formulation is a useful decision tool; as currently specified it is a promising blueprint but incomplete for deployment without further empirical and implementation validation."

The resulting weight vector w* is the recommended single static allocation for the investor under the stated modeling choices; sensitivity analyses (semivariance Sharpe, scenario\u2011weighted objective, and floor/cap relaxations) will validate robustness.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nModel form (minimax Sharpe):\n- Decision vector: w = [w_TSE, w_Gold, w_FI], with w_i \u2265 0 and \u03a3_i w_i = 1.\n- For each scenario s in S = {StatusQuo, Conflict, Normalization} define annualized expected returns mu_s (3\u00d71), covariance Sigma_s (3\u00d73), and a short\u2011term nominal risk\u2011free proxy r_f_s (scalar).\n- Introduce scalar t (annualized Sharpe). Solve:\n    maximize t\n    subject to, \u2200 s \u2208 S:\n       w' mu_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t * sqrt(w' Sigma_s w)\n       sqrt(w' Sigma_s w) \u2264 0.15\n    plus linear bounds: w_FI \u2265 0.30, w_TSE \u2264 0.45, w_Gold \u2264 0.60, w \u2265 0, \u03a3 w = 1.\n- Interpretation: t is the minimum across scenarios of (portfolio excess return)/volatility; the optimizer finds weights that maximize this worst\u2011case Sharpe while respecting a per\u2011scenario volatility cap.\n\nScenario parameterization (working baseline; all values annualized):\n- Status Quo (persistent sanctions, chronic inflation, infrastructure drag)\n  - mu_StatusQ = [TSE: +12%, Gold: +10%, FI: +18%]\n  - vols: \u03c3_TSE = 28%, \u03c3_Gold = 22%, \u03c3_FI = 12%\n  - correlations: \u03c1(TSE,Gold)= \u22120.10; \u03c1(TSE,FI)= +0.10; \u03c1(Gold,FI)= 0.00\n  - r_f_StatusQ = 18% (use short\u2011term nominal deposit/bill proxy; fallback = FI mu)\n- Conflict Escalation (direct military conflict \u2192 hyperinflation, equity crash)\n  - mu_Conflict = [TSE: \u221210%, Gold: +50%, FI: \u221230%]\n  - vols: \u03c3_TSE = 60%, \u03c3_Gold = 80%, \u03c3_FI = 40%\n  - correlations: \u03c1(TSE,Gold)= \u22120.60; \u03c1(TSE,FI)= \u22120.50; \u03c1(Gold,FI)= +0.10\n  - r_f_Conflict = capped at \u221220% for numerical stability (primary: short\u2011term nominal yield proxy)\n- Diplomatic Normalization (sanctions relief \u2192 recovery)\n  - mu_Normal = [TSE: +25%, Gold: +5%, FI: +10%]\n  - vols: \u03c3_TSE = 30%, \u03c3_Gold = 25%, \u03c3_FI = 12%\n  - correlations: \u03c1(TSE,Gold)= \u22120.20; \u03c1(TSE,FI)= \u22120.60; \u03c1(Gold,FI)= 0.00\n  - r_f_Normal = 10%\n\nNumerical solution approach:\n- The inequality w' mu_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t * sqrt(w' Sigma_s w) is quasiconvex in (w,t); for a fixed t the constraints reduce to second\u2011order cone constraints. Use bisection on t (search interval e.g., [\u22121.0, +3.0]) and at each t solve a feasibility SOCP.\n- Recommended solvers: MOSEK/ECOS with CVX/CVXPY interface; feasibility tolerance ~1e\u20116.\n- Report outputs: optimal w* = [w_TSE*, w_Gold*, w_FI*], achieved minimax Sharpe t*, per\u2011scenario portfolio annualized return, vol, and Sharpe; solver status.\n\nRobustness and diagnostics to run alongside primary solve:\n1) Scenario\u2011weighted Sharpe maximization (user probability vector \u03b1; default equal weights) to show allocation sensitivity to subjective scenario likelihoods.\n2) Semivariance\u2011based denominator (downside deviation) variant to test sensitivity to non\u2011normal/tail risk.\n3) Fiduciary bound sensitivity: alternative with w_FI \u2265 0.25 and w_TSE \u2264 0.50.\n4) Stress tests: perturb each mu_s by \u00b15% and recompute minimax t and w*; also perturb vols and correlations by \u00b110%.\n5) CVaR or terminal\u2011wealth downside constraint optional extension (if the investor demands explicit percentile shortfall control).\n\nImplementation notes and practical safeguards:\n- Annualization consistency: ensure mu_s and Sigma_s are on the same annual basis.\n- Use short\u2011term nominal domestic yields as r_f_s where available; otherwise fall back to scenario FI expected return but document the choice.\n- The r_f_Conflict floor (\u221220%) prevents numerically degenerate/unstable Sharpe constraints in extreme negative\u2011yield scenarios; sensitivity to this cap will be reported.\n- Provide clear documentation for regulatory/transactional limits (access to gold funds or foreign currency mechanics) before deployment.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable by empirical model outcomes and diagnostic checks:\n- If the SOCP bisection procedure yields infeasible constraints under the stated bounds and volatility cap (with nominal solver tolerances), the hypothesis that a feasible maximax\u2011Sharpe allocation exists under these inputs is falsified.\n- After computing w*, the hypothesis predicts a minimum expected annualized Sharpe t* across the three modeled scenarios. If, under independently estimated scenario parameter sets drawn from credible alternative data or out\u2011of\u2011sample realized returns over the next 10 years, the realized minimum annualized Sharpe is materially below t* (beyond sensitivity ranges reported), the practical effectiveness of the model/hypothesis is falsified.\n- Sensitivity falsification: if small perturbations within the declared uncertainty (\u00b15% mu, \u00b110% vol/corr) produce large, discontinuous shifts in w* or render the problem infeasible, the claimed robustness is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1) Scenario validity: the three scenario parameterizations credibly represent the relevant 10\u2011year macro outcomes for Iran (Status Quo, Conflict Escalation, Diplomatic Normalization). Unmodeled scenarios or probability shifts can change optimality.\n2) Stationarity within scenario: within each 10\u2011year scenario the annualized mu_s and Sigma_s are treated as constant (single\u2011period static allocation); no interim rebalancing is permitted.\n3) Investor preferences: a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor's moderate risk tolerance is captured by a per\u2011scenario annualized volatility cap of 15% and a fixed\u2011income floor of 30%.\n4) No shorting and full investment: weights nonnegative and sum to one.\n5) Risk\u2011free proxy: short\u2011term domestic nominal yields are an appropriate r_f_s; where missing, FI expected return is used with documented caveats.\n6) Risk measurement: Sharpe denominator is standard deviation (alternative semivariance variants reported for robustness).\n7) Numerical tractability: the conic reformulation and bisection approach produce reliable global feasibility tests for t; standard convex solvers produce accurate solutions under the declared tolerances.\n\nIf accepted, the next actionable step is to run the bisection+SOCP solver with these inputs and constraints, deliver w*, t*, per\u2011scenario metrics, and the robustness analyses enumerated above.",

The constraint w' mu_s - r_f_s >= t * sqrt(w' Sigma_s w) can be rewritten as a second\u2011order cone (SOC) constraint by introducing the matrix square root or using norm(Sigma_s^{1/2} w), so for fixed t the feasible set is an intersection of SOCs and linear constraints. Bisection on t with a feasibility SOCP at each step is a sound, standard approach. The per\u2011scenario volatility cap (sqrt(w' Sigma_s w) <= 0.15) is convex and compatible with the SOC formulation. Solvers such as MOSEK/ECOS via CVX/CVXPY are appropriate and will reliably produce optimal or infeasible status reports under reasonable tolerances.\n- Decision usefulness and robustness: The minimax\u2011Sharpe objective is a defensible conservative criterion for a risk\u2011sensitive investor seeking a single static allocation robust to adverse scenarios. The specified fiduciary bounds (w_FI >= 30%, etc.) encode conservative preferences consistent with a near\u2011retirement investor. The plan explicitly lists multiple robustness diagnostics (scenario\u2011weighted variant, semivariance denominator, stress perturbations, CVaR extension) which together create a credible battery to validate the recommended w*.\n- Implementation practicality: The hypothesis sensibly limits the problem dimension (3 assets), which keeps estimation and solver burden low and improves interpretability. The falsifiability statements are concrete: infeasibility under constraints or high sensitivity to small perturbations are clear rejection rules. The numerical solution outputs (w*, per\u2011scenario metrics, solver status) are well defined and actionable.\n\nSkeptic:\n- Scenario parameter provenance and realism: The mu_s and Sigma_s values appear ad hoc and economically inconsistent in places. Examples: Status Quo lists FI mu = +18% and r_f = 18% (yielding zero nominal excess return for FI), while Conflict Escalation lists FI mu = -30% but also sets r_f_Conflict = capped at -20% \u2014 mixing nominal expected returns and a short\u2011term yield proxy without clear distinction between nominal vs real returns risks misrepresenting excess returns. Some volatilities and correlations (e.g., gold \u03c3=80% in Conflict, FI \u03c3=40%) are extreme but perhaps plausible in crisis; nonetheless these must be justified with historical/empirical or expert\u2011elicited sources specific to Iran. Without principled calibration, the optimizer may produce allocations driven by estimation artefacts rather than investor preferences.\n- Sharpe as the objective and negative/volatile risk\u2011free proxies: The model uses nominal Sharpe ratios across scenarios with different r_f_s. Sharpe ratios behave poorly when returns are non\u2011normal, when r_f is very negative, or when expected returns are near r_f; they are not coherent for distributions with heavy tails. The explicit cap r_f_Conflict = -20% is an ad hoc numerical device that can distort the objective: a very negative r_f increases numerators and can artificially inflate scenario Sharpe, complicating a minimax calibration. When volatilities differ greatly across scenarios, maximizing the minimum Sharpe may produce unintuitive allocations that rely on the arbitrary r_f settings.\n- Feasibility and tight volatility cap: Enforcing sqrt(w' Sigma_s w) <= 0.15 in each scenario while also imposing fiduciary bounds (w_FI >= 0.30, w_TSE <= 0.45, etc.) can easily render the problem infeasible given the high per\u2011asset vols in the Conflict and Normalization scenarios. The diagnostic that infeasibility falsifies the hypothesis is correct; but it means feasibility depends critically on plausibility of the 15% cap relative to scenario vol matrices. The hypothesis' claim that a feasible allocation exists is therefore contingent on the provided parameter choices.\n- Hidden and operational assumptions: The model omits currency risk, taxes, transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and legal/operational access limits (sanctions, capital controls, ability to hold foreign assets or stablecoins). For a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor these can be decisive. Also the static single\u2011period 10\u2011year hold assumption presumes stationarity within scenario and ignores rebalancing or lifecycle income needs; that may not be suitable for retirement planning. The claim that this single w* is \"recommended\" requires additional fiduciary and practical vetting.\n- Numerical pitfalls and solver considerations: Although SOC reformulation is correct, numerical issues can arise: if mu_s and r_f_s are large in magnitude or differ across scenarios, bisection bounds for t need careful setting and initial feasibility checks. The constraint is quasiconvex in (w,t), but the feasible region for t may be empty or extremely narrow, and solver tolerances must be chosen to avoid accepting spurious feasibility.\n\nSynthesis and pragmatic judgment:\n- Core idea verdict: The overall methodological design is sound: casting a robust (minimax) Sharpe optimization as an SOCP feasibility/bisection problem is mathematically valid and computationally tractable for a three\u2011asset static allocation. The proposed diagnostics (semivariance, scenario weighting, stress perturbations, CVaR/terminal\u2011wealth checks) are appropriate and necessary complements.\n- Key gaps that must be closed before deployment: most importantly, the scenario parameterization (mu_s, Sigma_s, r_f_s) needs defensible empirical grounding or structured expert elicitation specific to Iran and the three asset proxies used. The distinction between nominal and real returns must be made explicit and consistently applied across mu_s and r_f_s. Operational constraints (access to funds, currency conversion, custody of gold, taxes, liquidity) and the investor's full financial situation (liabilities, other income, retirement timing) should be integrated or at least discussed as external constraints.\n- Numerical and modeling recommendations (summary): (1) pre\u2011check feasibility by computing scenario\u2011wise minimum achievable volatility given fiduciary bounds; (2) calibrate r_f_s to short\u2011term nominal yields and treat expected returns as nominal too (or convert both to real consistently); (3) prefer semivariance/Sortino or utility\u2011based robust objectives if return distributions are heavy\u2011tailed; (4) run the sensitivity battery (\u00b15% mu, \u00b110% vol/corr, r_f caps) as proposed and augment it with liquidity/tax impact scenarios; (5) validate results against historical backtests (if data available) and expert scenario elicitation; (6) consider an alternative formulation that maximizes minimax expected excess terminal wealth or minimizes worst\u2011case CVaR, since Sharpe ignores skewness and tail risk which are important in geopolitical regimes.\n\nNet conclusion: Proceed with a technical implementation only after (a) anchoring scenario parameters to empirical or expert inputs and clarifying nominal vs real conventions, (b) running feasibility checks for the 15% cap under fiduciary bounds, and (c) expanding diagnostics to include downside/CVaR measures and operational constraints. If these preparatory steps are done, the proposed framework is a valid and useful approach for producing a conservative static allocation; as currently specified it is promising but missing critical calibration and practical constraints."

The resulting allocation will be conservatively biased (limited TSE weight, material gold and fixed\u2011income) when calibrated to plausible Iran\u2011specific parameterizations, and the approach remains testable and implementable for a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor.\n\n#### Hypothesis Statement\nMaximize t\nsubject to, for each scenario s \u2208 {StatusQuo, Conflict, Normalization}:\n  (\u03bc_s_real' w \u2212 r_real_s) / sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) \u2265 t\n  sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) \u2264 \u03c3_cap (\u03c3_cap = 15% pa)\nplus linear constraints:\n  sum_i w_i = 1, w_i \u2265 0 (i \u2208 {TSE, Gold, FI})\nOptionally enforce age\u2011informed box bounds (tunable): w_TSE \u2264 0.30, w_FI \u2265 0.20, 0 \u2264 w_Gold \u2264 0.60.\nSolve by bisection on t where each feasibility test is an SOC problem (||\u03a3_s^(1/2) w||_2 \u2264 (\u03bc_s_real' w \u2212 r_real_s)/t and ||\u03a3_s^(1/2) w||_2 \u2264 \u03c3_cap). Report the maximized worst\u2011case annualized real Sharpe t* and the corresponding static weight vector w*.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nModeling choices\n- Performance metric: real Sharpe (use expected nominal returns \u03bc_s_nominal minus expected scenario inflation Einfl_s to form \u03bc_s_real; use real short\u2011rate r_real_s = r_nominal_s \u2212 Einfl_s or set to 0 where deposit rates lag inflation). This avoids misleading nominal Sharpe in high inflation regimes.\n- Scenario parameterization (to be calibrated from recent TSE, local gold (IRR) and fixed\u2011income yields + expert judgment):\n  - Status Quo: persistent sanctions, chronic inflation \u2014 moderate nominal gains for TSE, elevated vols; gold positive; FI nominal yields high but low/negative real.\n  - Conflict Escalation: direct conflict \u2192 hyperinflation, TSE crash, huge vol spike; gold strong positive; FI may have negative nominal/real expectations or high volatility.\n  - Diplomatic Normalization: sanctions relief \u2192 strong equity rally, compressed vol, gold flat/negative, FI yields compress.\n- Estimate \u03bc_s_nominal and \u03a3_s from data using monthly returns annualized, shrinkage (Ledoit\u2013Wolf) for \u03a3 stabilization, multiply vol by stress factors per scenario (Conflict: \u00d71.5\u20132.0). Build uncertainty sets \u03bc_s \u2208 [\u03bc\u0302_s \u00b1 \u03b4\u03bc] and \u03a3 perturbations for robustness checks.\n- Constraints: no short selling; sum to 1; per\u2011scenario volatility cap (hard) ensures \"moderate risk tolerance\" in each scenario. Optional practical box bounds encode age/liquidity preferences as sensitivity knobs.\n- Solution method: SOC\u2011bisection on t. For each t candidate solve convex feasibility with an SOC solver (MOSEK/GUROBI/ECOS via CVXPy). If \u03bc_s_real' w \u2212 r_real_s < 0 for some s then t>0 is infeasible \u2014 report t* = 0 then consider alternate metrics (Sortino/CVaR) or relax bounds.\n- Variants and robustness:\n  - Minimax Sortino: replace \u03c3 with downside deviation in denominator for downside\u2011focus.\n  - Weighted\u2011Sharpe alternative: maximize weighted average of scenario Sharpe (weights = scenario probabilities) for comparison.\n  - Robust counterpart: enforce constraints for worst \u03bc \u2208 ellipsoidal uncertainty set (more conservative).\n  - Tail constraints: add CVaR or worst\u2011year loss limits if investor needs explicit drawdown caps.\nImplementation deliverables\n- Calibrated baseline \u03bc_s_nominal, Einfl_s, \u03a3_s, r_nominal_s with uncertainty bounds.\n- CVXPy implementation of SOC\u2011bisection returning t* and w*.\n- Diagnostics: per\u2011scenario E[R] (real), \u03c3, Sharpe; sensitivity sweeps over \u03c3_cap (12\u201318%), box bounds, \u03bc/\u03c3 perturbations; CVaR and worst\u2011year loss simulations.\nExpected qualitative outcome\n- Given high TSE vol under plausible Iran conditions and a 15% cap, the minimax real\u2011Sharpe allocation will limit equity exposure (likely \u226430%), allocate materially to gold for tail hedging and to fixed\u2011income for income/liquidity. Exact weights require calibration and solver run; present both minimax and weighted\u2011Sharpe allocations for investor choice.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable by empirical model execution and counterexample:\n1) Implement the specified optimization with agreed scenario parameter sets and solver tolerances. If a feasible weight vector w exists that achieves a higher minimum scenario real Sharpe than the reported w* while satisfying all constraints (sum to 1, w\u22650, per\u2011scenario \u03c3 \u2264 15%), then the claimed w* is not optimal and the hypothesis is falsified.\n2) If, after reasonable parameter uncertainty and stress tests, the solution procedure cannot find any w with t* > 0 (i.e., no allocation achieves positive worst\u2011case real Sharpe) but an alternate, demonstrably implementable allocation (e.g., via weighted\u2011Sharpe or robust counterpart) yields strictly better worst\u2011case real Sharpe while respecting constraints, the minimax formulation claim fails.\n3) Over an ex\u2011post 10\u2011year realization matching one of the scenarios, if the real Sharpe of w* is materially below the modeled per\u2011scenario expected Sharpe (beyond stated uncertainty bounds), then modeling assumptions (\u03bc_s, Einfl_s, \u03a3_s) \u2014 and thus the formulation under those assumptions \u2014 are empirically rejected and must be revised.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Investor is single\u2011period static (no intra\u2011decadal rebalancing) and fully invests only in the three asset classes (TSE index funds, gold funds, fixed\u2011income funds).\n- No short selling; weights nonnegative; sum to 1.\n- Moderate risk tolerance encoded as per\u2011scenario annualized volatility cap \u03c3_cap = 15% (tunable).\n- Scenario definitions capture the economically relevant states (Status Quo, Conflict, Normalization) over the next 10 years; expected nominal returns, inflation, volatilities and correlations for each scenario are estimable and can be translated into real expected returns \u03bc_s_real and covariance \u03a3_s.\n- Asset returns are summarized adequately for this single\u2011period optimization by their scenario means and covariances (higher\u2011moment and tail effects can be incorporated via Sortino/CVaR variants or robust uncertainty sets if desired).\n- Solvers can reliably solve the SOC feasibility problems; numerical issues (RHS nonnegativity or infeasibility) will be diagnosed and reported.\n- Optional age\u2011informed box constraints reflect investor preferences and are applied only when explicitly chosen.\n\nIf this finalized formulation (real\u2011Sharpe maximin, SOC\u2011bisection, volatility cap, optional box bounds, and robust/sensitivity analyses) is accepted, the next step is to calibrate \u03bc_s_nominal, Einfl_s, \u03a3_s and r_nominal_s from recent TSE/gold/fixed\u2011income data plus expert adjustments and run the solver to produce the definitive static allocation w* and diagnostic outputs.",

With realistic Iran\u2011specific scenario parameterizations (see Detailed Description) and the conservative 15% worst\u2011case volatility constraint, w* will place material weight in gold and fixed\u2011income and a limited allocation to equities appropriate for a 58\u2011year\u2011old investor; this allocation is robust to moderate parameter misspecification via ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and tail\u2011risk adjustments.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\n1) Mathematical formulation (single\u2011period):\n- Decision variable w \u2208 R^3, w \u2265 0, 1' w = 1.\n- For scenario s: \u03bc_s \u2208 R^3 (annualized nominal expected returns), \u03a3_s \u2208 S^3_+ (annualized covariance), r_f_s (annualized short rate).\n- Define \u03c3_s(w) = sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) and S_s(w) = (w' \u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s)/\u03c3_s(w).\n- Objective: maximize t subject to w' \u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t \u03c3_s(w) \u2200s, \u03c3_s(w) \u2264 0.15 \u2200s.\n\n2) Computational solution:\n- Reformulate as a sequence of convex feasibility SOCPs by fixing t and checking feasibility:\n    for each s: w' \u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t \u00b7 ||L_s w||_2, where L_s is Cholesky factor of \u03a3_s.\n    and ||L_s w||_2 \u2264 0.15.\n- Use bisection on t (e.g., tolerance 1e\u22124) and solve feasibility SOCPs in CVX/CVXPY with solvers (MOSEK preferred; ECOS/SCS acceptable).\n- Add robustification: model mean ambiguity as \u03bc_s \u2208 {\u03bc\u0302_s + \u03b4 : ||\u03b4||_2 \u2264 \u03b5_s} (ellipsoidal).

Use shrinkage on \u03a3_s where sample data are noisy.\n\n4) Modelling extensions and risk controls (to be included in practical runs):\n- Tail\u2011risk: optionally replace \u03c3_s(w) in denominator with downside volatility or use scenario\u2011specific CVaR constraints (e.g., 1\u2011year 95% CVaR limit) to better capture hyperinflation/market crash tails.\n- Age\u2011appropriate soft constraints: recommend (verbal advisory) floor on fixed income (e.g., w_fix \u2265 25\u201335%) and cap on equities (w_eq \u2264 50%) for a 58\u2011year\u2011old; include as optional linear constraints and report results with/without them.\n- Scenario weighting and alternative volatility cap modes: primary proposal uses worst\u2011case (max_s \u03c3 \u2264 0.15). If infeasible, switch to scenario\u2011weighted volatility cap or raise \u03c3_cap modestly (e.g., 17\u201320%) and re\u2011solve.\n- Sensitivity/robustness: sweep \u03bc_s \u00b110\u201320%, \u03a3_s scale \u00b110\u201330%, and vary \u03b5_s (ambiguity radius) to test allocation stability.\n\n5) Practical interpretation and expected structure of solution:\n- Given high nominal volatilities in Iran, the 15% worst\u2011case cap will typically force high fixed\u2011income and/or gold weights; gold will act as a crisis hedge in CE, fixed income will control volatility across SQ and DN, equities will be nonzero only to the extent they can improve worst\u2011case Sharpe without violating \u03c3_cap.\n- If no feasible w exists (common under extreme CE parameters), either relax \u03c3_cap, permit a small cash buffer outside the three assets, or switch to scenario\u2011weighted volatility constraint.\n\n6) Implementation checklist:\n- Calibrate scenario \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s and r_f_s from TSE history, local gold price series, and fixed\u2011income yields (complement with expert posterior for CE and DN).\n- Implement bisection + SOCP feasibility in CVXPY; run robustified version with ellipsoidal mean uncertainty.\n- Report w*, scenario Sharpe S_s(w*), \u03c3_s(w*), expected nominal returns, and tail metrics; present sensitivity tables.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable both computationally and empirically:\n- Computational falsification: If a different feasible weight vector w' satisfying all constraints yields a strictly higher minimum scenario Sharpe than w* (within numerical tolerance), the hypothesis (that w* as computed is optimal) is false.\n- Parameterization falsification: If, after rigorous local calibration (historical data + expert elicitation) and applying the identical optimization procedure, no feasible allocation exists under the 15% worst\u2011case volatility cap, then the hypothesis (existence of a feasible optimal static allocation under these parameters) is false.\n- Empirical falsification (ex\u2011post): Over the 10\u2011year horizon, simulate forward returns under the three scenario realizations (or observe realized regime outcomes). If the computed allocation consistently underperforms alternative constrained allocations on the minimum realized scenario Sharpe or violates the volatility cap in realized data, the practical validity is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- The investor holds a static allocation for 10 years with no interim rebalancing.\n- Only three asset classes are permitted: Tehran Stock Exchange index funds, domestic gold funds, domestic fixed\u2011income funds.\n- No short sales; weights are nonnegative and sum to 1.\n- Scenario parameterizations (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) capture the directional macroeconomic/geopolitical states and are calibrated reasonably from local data and expert views; initial illustrative values provided above.\n- Volatility cap is interpreted as annualized standard deviation and enforced in every scenario (worst\u2011case mode); cap default is 15% reflecting moderate risk tolerance for a 58\u2011year\u2011old investor.\n- Return distributions are adequately summarized by first and second moments for the SOCP approach; tail adjustments (CVaR or higher moments) are added if tails materially affect feasibility or preferences.\n- Robustness to parameter misspecification will be modeled via ellipsoidal uncertainty sets for expected returns (and optionally covariance), with radii chosen by expert elicitation or statistical confidence intervals.\n\nIf stakeholders agree to (A) worst\u2011case volatility cap = 15%, (B) adopt the illustrative scenario priors above as starting calibration, and (C) use the bisection+SOCP solver with ellipsoidal robustification and optional age\u2011appropriate floors, I endorse proceeding to compute w* numerically and produce the explicit static allocation and scenario performance tables.",

Optionally report real (inflation\u2011adjusted) Sharpe as a secondary experiment by subtracting scenario inflation from \u03bc and r_f.\n- Governance: present primary w* plus scenario-specific Sharpe/vol/return diagnostics and stress tables for CE tail risk.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable in two concrete ways:\n1) Computational falsification: If a different feasible allocation w' satisfying all stated constraints (w' \u2265 0, sum=1, per-scenario \u03c3 \u2264 15%, w'_FI \u2265 30%, w'_TSE \u2264 50%) yields a strictly larger worst-case nominal Sharpe than the reported w*, then the claim that w* maximizes the problem is false.\n2) Empirical falsification over the 10-year horizon: if the realized ex\u2011post minimum across the three realized scenario outcomes of the portfolio\u2019s annualized nominal Sharpe (computed on actual returns and realized volatilities in IRR) is consistently and materially lower than the model\u2019s ex\u2011ante worst-case Sharpe under reasonable updates to scenario identification/realizations, the model\u2019s predictive adequacy and practical recommendation are falsified (subject to declared input uncertainty).\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Nominal local\u2011currency (IRR) returns and yields are the relevant metric for the investor (primary Sharpe measured in nominal IRR terms).\n- The three scenario parameter sets (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) meaningfully summarize plausible 10\u2011year macro/regime outcomes in Iran; these are a working default and should be adjusted by domain experts if new information emerges.\n- Volatility cap of 15% annualized is appropriate for \u201cmoderate\u201d risk for a 58\u2011year\u2011old and must hold in every scenario to satisfy risk tolerance.\n- No short selling; fully invested; single-period static allocation held for 10 years (no interim rebalancing).\n- Robustness runs (\u03bc-ellipsoid \u03b4_\u03bc = 5%, \u03a3 inflation \u03b1 up to 0.2, FI floor variants) will accompany the primary result to quantify model risk.\n- SOC bisection solver finds global optimum under given convex formulation and given inputs.\n\nIf the group accepts nominal Sharpe as primary, per\u2011scenario vol cap 15%, FI floor 30%, TSE cap 50%, and \u03bc-uncertainty \u03b4_\u03bc = 5% for robustness runs, then the above specification is final and ready for execution to produce the single recommended static allocation and its sensitivity suite.",

Similarly, if sensitivity runs (caps 12%/15%/18%, r_f variants, lifecycle bounds) show that the allocation materially contradicts lifecycle risk norms or produces unacceptable real losses under plausible inflation adjustments, the pragmatic advisability of the allocation is falsified.\n\nConcretely verifiable outcomes that validate the hypothesis:\n- A solver returns w* satisfying constraints and yields t* (max\u2011min Sharpe) and per\u2011scenario Sharpe_s(w*) \u2265 t*, with max_s V_s(w*) \u2264 0.15.\n- Sensitivity analyses show stable, interpretable shifts in w* under reasonable parameter perturbations.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- The three scenarios and their numeric parameterizations (\u03bc_s, \u03c3_s, \u03c1_s) correctly and sufficiently represent forward 10\u2011year conditional expectations for Iran\u2019s macro/geopolitical states.\n- Short\u2011term 1\u2011year sovereign bill yields are an appropriate r_f,s baseline for Sharpe calculations; \u03bc_FI,s is retained as an alternate conservative benchmark.\n- Nominal returns are used for base-case optimization; real/inflation\u2011adjusted results reported separately.\n- No short selling; fully invested; single\u2011period static allocation with no interim rebalancing.\n- The investor\u2019s risk tolerance is captured by a worst\u2011case annualized volatility cap (base 15%); this cap is binding for the robust objective.\n- Covariances \u03a3_s are stationary within each scenario over the 10\u2011year horizon (i.e., no intra\u2011scenario time variation modeled).\n- Implementation via SOC + bisection yields global optimum for the max\u2011min Sharpe formulation under the above convexified constraint set.\n\nNext step (consensus request): proceed to run the SOC+bisection solver with primary choices\u2014r_f,s = scenario\u2011adjusted 1y bill yields, base vol cap 15%, lifecycle bounds OFF\u2014and produce the numerical w*, t*, and sensitivity outputs described above.",

The resulting weight vector w* is the optimal static allocation for a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor with moderate risk tolerance under the stated assumptions and uncertainty specifications.\n\n#### Hypothesis Statement\nMaximize t subject to, for each scenario s \u2208 {SQ, CE, DN}:\n- w' \u03bc_s \u2265 t \u00b7 sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w)\n- sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) \u2264 0.15\nwith sum_i w_i = 1, w_i \u2265 0, w_TSE \u2264 0.40, w_fixed \u2265 0.30, 0.10 \u2264 w_gold \u2264 0.40. Work in excess\u2011return space (r_f_s = 0). The optimizer w* that attains the maximal feasible t is the unique static allocation that maximizes the portfolio\u2019s minimum expected annualized Sharpe Ratio across the three scenarios given the specified \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, uncertainty sets and constraints.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\n1. Decision variables\n   - w = [w_TSE, w_gold, w_fixed], w_i \u2265 0, sum w = 1, box constraints as above.\n   - scalar t = minimum scenario Sharpe to be maximized.\n\n2. Scenario parameterization (annualized excess returns and risk structure; replaceable/updatable)\n   - Status Quo (SQ): \u03bc_SQ = [8%, 5%, 10%]; vol vector \u03c3_SQ = [30%, 18%, 12%]; correlations: \u03c1(TSE,Gold) = \u22120.10, \u03c1(TSE,Fixed) = 0.20, \u03c1(Gold,Fixed)=0.00.\n   - Conflict Escalation (CE): \u03bc_CE = [\u221230%, 40%, \u221225%]; base vol vector \u03c3_CE_base = [60%, 40%, 35%]; inflate by 1.25 \u2192 \u03c3_CE = [75%, 50%, 43.75%]; correlations: \u03c1(TSE,Gold) = \u22120.60, \u03c1(TSE,Fixed) = 0.60, \u03c1(Gold,Fixed) = \u22120.20.\n   - Diplomatic Normalization (DN): \u03bc_DN = [30%, 2%, 10%]; vol vector \u03c3_DN = [25%, 15%, 10%]; correlations: \u03c1(TSE,Gold) = 0.00, \u03c1(TSE,Fixed) = 0.15, \u03c1(Gold,Fixed) = 0.00.\n   - Build \u03a3_s from \u03c3_s and \u03c1_s (3\u00d73 covariance matrices). CE covariance is further conservatively inflated by +25% (applied above to vols).\n\n3. Robustness / uncertainty\n   - Allow each scenario mean vector to vary within an ellipsoidal (Euclidean) uncertainty set: \u03bc_s \u2192 \u03bc_s + \u0394\u03bc_s with ||\u0394\u03bc_s||2 \u2264 0.025 (\u00b12.5 percentage points total magnitude) as a sensitivity/robustness check. Alternatively, run worst\u2011case runs with \u03bc degraded by 20% in favorable scenarios.\n   - Tail\u2011aware covariance: CE already inflated by 25%; optionally scale \u03a3_s upward as further conservatism.\n\n4. Optimization formulation and tractable solution\n   - For fixed candidate t0, feasibility problem is convex (SOCP): for each s, enforce linear left side w' \u03bc_s \u2265 t0 \u00b7 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w||2 and enforce ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w||2 \u2264 0.15.\n   - Solve with bisection on t (e.g., t_low = \u22121, t_high = 3).

Diagnostics and sensitivity analysis to produce\n   - SR_s(w*), expected excess returns w' \u03bc_s, vol sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) per scenario.\n   - Robustness to \u03bc perturbations (ellipsoidal worst\u2011case), +25% \u03a3_CE, and relaxing caps (e.g., max equity 50%).\n   - Ex\u2011post stress tests and scenario probability\u2013weighted alternatives for comparison.\n\n6. Practical recommended constraints for a 58\u2011year\u2011old moderate investor\n   - No shorting, fully invested, per\u2011scenario vol \u2264 15%, w_TSE \u2264 40%, w_fixed \u2265 30%, 10% \u2264 w_gold \u2264 40%. Use excess returns (r_f = 0) convention for modeling clarity.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable. After selecting the proposed w* and holding it static for the 10\u2011year horizon:\n- If the realized macro path corresponds to one of the modeled scenarios and the realized annualized excess return and volatility of the portfolio produce a realized scenario Sharpe less than the model\u2019s worst\u2011case predicted t* by an amount exceeding estimation error bounds (and a different feasible static allocation respecting the same constraints would have produced a higher realized minimum Sharpe across realized scenario(s)), then the hypothesis is falsified.\n- More generally, if an alternative feasible static allocation (respecting the same constraints) empirically yields a higher realized minimum Sharpe across the actually observed scenario sequence (over the 10 years), then the claim that w* maximizes the minimum expected Sharpe under the stated inputs is falsified.\n- The model\u2019s input assumptions (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, uncertainty radii, per\u2011scenario vol cap, and box constraints) are explicit; divergence of realized regime statistics beyond these assumptions invalidates the applicability of the hypothesis rather than the mathematical solution.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. Scenario completeness: The three narratives (SQ, CE, DN) capture the relevant 10\u2011year macro\u2011regime outcomes for Iran; one of them or a weighted combination will be representative of realized conditions.\n2. Input realism: The supplied \u03bc_s and \u03a3_s (and their uncertainty bands) are credible priors for excess returns and risks under each scenario\u2014these numbers are replaceable but must be fixed for the optimization.\n3. Excess\u2011return convention: r_f_s = 0 (work in returns in excess of scenario short cash) to avoid nominal/real conversion ambiguity.\n4. Static horizon: No rebalancing over 10 years; a single static allocation is held throughout.\n5. Constraints: No shorting, weights sum to 1, per\u2011scenario volatility cap \u2264 15% enforced for all scenarios, and box constraints w_TSE \u2264 40%, w_fixed \u2265 30%, 10% \u2264 w_gold \u2264 40% reflect the investor\u2019s moderate risk tolerance.\n6. Tractability: Covariance matrices \u03a3_s are positive definite and numerical solvers reliably solve the SOCP feasibility problems arising in bisection.\n7. Robustness framing: Ellipsoidal uncertainty (||\u0394\u03bc_s||2 \u2264 0.025) and covariance inflation (CE +25%) sufficiently capture mean and tail uncertainty for sensitivity checks; larger unmodeled shocks may change optimal choices.\n\nIf the panel accepts these parameter choices and constraints, the SOCP+bisection procedure will produce the candidate optimal static allocation w* and its diagnostics; sensitivity analyses under the stated uncertainty sets will quantify robustness.",

The formulation explicitly enforces box constraints and per-scenario variance caps, and the paper-style diagnostics (SR_s, w'\u03bc_s, sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w), sensitivity to \u03bc perturbations, \u03a3 inflation) are appropriate. Implementable solvers (MOSEK, ECOS, SCS) handle SOCPs; numerical checks (PSD of \u03a3, conditioning) are routine. For a 58\u2011year\u2011old moderate investor, the box constraints (max equities 40%, min fixed 30%, gold 10\u201340%) are conservative and align with a risk-averse tilt; working in excess\u2011return space (r_f = 0) simplifies modeling.\n\nSkeptic:\nSeveral critical issues threaten the hypothesis as stated.

A quick constructive check shows that even extreme allocations (e.g., putting as much weight as allowed into the lowest-vol asset) produce portfolio vol well above 15% under CE. Example: take w = [0, 0.1, 0.9] (equity 0, gold at its lower bound 10%, fixed income 90%) and CE vols \u03c3_CE = [75%, 50%, 43.75%] with \u03c1(Gold,Fixed) = \u22120.2. Portfolio variance \u2248 1496.65 (i.e., \u03c3 \u2248 38.7%), far above 15%. Allocating 100% to fixed income yields \u03c3 = 43.75%. Therefore the per-scenario volatility cap makes the feasibility set empty under the supplied CE covariance/vol numbers and box constraints. The solver will report infeasible for any t, so the bisection procedure cannot produce a w*.\n\nOther issues:\n- The claimed uniqueness of w* is overstated. The maximal t* is unique as a scalar, but there can be multiple weight vectors attaining the same worst-case Sharpe (flat faces of feasible region). Uniqueness of w* must be proven or qualification added.\n- The scenario \u03bc_s vectors are extreme and asymmetric. CE has very negative \u03bc for TSE and fixed income but +40% for gold \u2014 these are plausible narratively but should be justified and unit\u2011checked (nominal vs real returns, currency devaluation, asset return definitions). The uncertainty radius (||\u0394\u03bc_s||2 \u2264 0.025) is small relative to some scenario means and may understate model risk in high\u2011uncertainty regimes.\n- Using r_f = 0 simplifies algebra but can be misleading when real cash yields, inflation, or currency effects differ across scenarios. Sharpe comparisons across scenarios implicitly assume comparable discounting and units; make that explicit.\n- The model ignores operational constraints for an Iranian investor: access to suitably diversified TSE-traded index funds, sanctions-driven liquidity limitations, FX and currency devaluation risk, transaction costs, taxes, and shorting restrictions beyond no shorting. These practicalities can materially change feasibility and effective returns.\n- Tail risk control via per-scenario \u03c3 \u2264 15% is a blunt instrument. If the goal is tail protection, a CVaR or tail-quantile constraint is more directly aligned; the authors mention optional CVaR checks but do not incorporate them.\n- Numerical issues: ensure \u03a3_s are PSD, check conditioning and scaling; covariance inflation and sqrt(\u03a3) operations must be implemented carefully to avoid solver instability.\n\nSynthesis and conclusion:\nMathematically the SOCP+bisection approach is correct and implementable provided the feasibility region is nonempty. However, with the parameter values supplied the problem is infeasible because the CE scenario's volatilities (after 25% inflation) are so large that no allocation within the stated box constraints can meet the 15% annualized volatility cap. This is a decisive, constructive falsification of the hypothesis as written (the optimization problem has no feasible solution, so no w* exists). Even if the CE vols were lower, several model assumptions need tightening: justify scenario \u03bc and \u03a3, clarify units (nominal vs excess returns), reconsider r_f = 0 choice, remove or soften the strong claim of uniqueness, and account for practical implementation constraints (liquidity, currency, fund availability). The hypothesis is therefore not supported in its current parametrization and requires one or more of these corrective actions to become feasible and informative.\n\nOperational recommendations (short):\n1) Before optimization run a per-scenario feasibility check: minimize sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w) subject to box constraints and sum-to-one to find the minimal achievable \u03c3_s; if min \u03c3_s > 0.15 for any s, then the 15% cap must be relaxed or the scenario vol inputs changed. 2) Replace/augment per-scenario \u03c3 caps with CVaR or probabilistic tail constraints if the goal is tail protection. 3) Rework scenario \u03bc/\u03a3 with grounded empirical or expert-calibrated inputs, and expand \u03bc uncertainty radius. 4) Remove the categorical uniqueness claim and report multiplicity or select a secondary tie-breaker (e.g., maximize expected return among maximizers of t). 5) Include operational constraints (currency, liquidity) as scenario or constraint modifiers. 6) Provide a --literature-file to ground scenario priors and justify vol/mu choices.\n\nIf the CE vol inputs are revised downward or the volatility cap is relaxed (e.g., to >35\u201340% in CE, or applied only to non-CE scenarios), the SOCP approach will produce a valid w* along with diagnostics and robustness checks that are meaningful for the investor."

This w* is recommended as the static 10\u2011year allocation for the 58\u2011year\u2011old moderate\u2011risk Iranian investor given the model and priors below.\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\n1) Optimization problem (operational):\n- Variables: w \u2208 R^3, t \u2208 R\n- Maximize t\n- Subject to (for each scenario s \u2208 {SQ, CE, DN}):\n  - w\u2032\u03bc_s \u2265 t \u00b7 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w||2   (ensures scenario Sharpe \u2265 t)\n  - ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w||2 \u2264 0.15        (volatility cap per scenario)\n- Portfolio constraints:\n  - sum(w)=1, w_i \u2265 0 \u2200 i\n  - equity cap: wE \u2264 0.50\n  - fixed\u2011income floor: wF \u2265 0.25\n- Implementation: Solve by bisection on t. For a fixed t, the constraints are second\u2011order cone (SOC) convex; use a conic solver (MOSEK, ECOS, SCS, CVX/convex.jl). Optionally add robust uncertainty sets on \u03bc_s and \u03a3_s (e.g., \u03bc_s \u2208 [\u03bc\u0302_s \u00b1 \u0394\u03bc], \u03a3_s in spectral norm ball) to produce a conservatively robust solution.\n\n2) Scenario parameter priors (real annual returns; used as the testing priors unless calibrated differently):\n- Status Quo (SQ):\n  - \u03bc_SQ = [Equity 6%, Gold 3%, Fixed  -2%]\n  - \u03c3 = [30%, 20%, 8%], \u03c1(E,G)=0.10, \u03c1(E,F)=0.00, \u03c1(G,F)=-0.10\n- Conflict Escalation (CE):\n  - \u03bc_CE = [Equity -30%, Gold 20%, Fixed -40%]\n  - \u03c3 = [60%, 40%, 30%], \u03c1(E,G)=-0.30, \u03c1(E,F)=-0.20, \u03c1(G,F)=-0.10\n- Diplomatic Normalization (DN):\n  - \u03bc_DN = [Equity 20%, Gold -5%, Fixed 5%]\n  - \u03c3 = [25%, 20%, 10%], \u03c1(E,G)=0.20, \u03c1(E,F)=0.10, \u03c1(G,F)=0.00\n- Real risk\u2011free baseline: r_real = 0% (Sharpe computed using real excess returns). These priors reflect the macro narratives and are open to calibration using local data.\n\n3) Robust and complementary features:\n- Optionally incorporate uncertainty sets for \u03bc_s (e.g., \u00b11\u20133% bands) and \u03a3_s (e.g., \u00b110% on volatility or correlation uncertainty) and require constraints to hold for all parameter draws (robust SOC formulation) \u2014 this reduces parameter\u2011sensitivity and is recommended given Iran\u2019s high uncertainty.\n- Tail\u2011risk adjustment: include an auxiliary CVaR constraint across scenario mixtures or enforce a lower bound on a stress quantile (e.g., one\u2011year 10th percentile) computed via scenario\u2011specific nonnormal tail parametric or Monte Carlo models.\n- Alternative objectives (for sensitivity): weighted scenario Sharpe maximization or mean\u2011variance formulations can be computed for comparison, but the primary test is the minimax\u2011Sharpe solution above.\n\n4) Practical steps to test:\n- Fix priors (above) or calibrate to local historical/forward data.\n- Implement solver routine (bisection on t; feasibility via SOC).\n- Report w*, achieved worst\u2011case Sharpe t*, per\u2011scenario returns, and scenario volatilities.\n- Compare sensitivity when relaxing/tightening bounds (e.g., equity cap 60% \u2192 50%, fixed floor 20% \u2192 25%) and when adding parametric uncertainty.\n\n5) Expected qualitative form of w* (to guide interpretation):\n- Due to CE\u2019s severe negative expected returns on equity and fixed income but positive on gold, the minimax objective with a 15% vol cap will bias toward gold and enforced fixed\u2011income floor, and limit equity exposure \u2014 hence the asserted direction wG \u2265 wE and wF \u2265 25%.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable: implement the specified optimization with the stated priors and constraints. If the computed optimal static allocation w* violates any of the claimed structural outcomes (for example, if wE > wG, or wF < 25%, or the solver finds that no feasible w exists under the 15% per\u2011scenario volatility cap), then the hypothesis is falsified. Additionally, if robustification (reasonable uncertainty bands) or small changes in plausible priors reverse the qualitative ordering (gold not overweight equity) or force infeasibility, the hypothesis is rejected. Numerical disagreement between the derived w* and the asserted direction (gold overweight, equity limited, fixed\u2011income floor) falsifies the prediction.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Decision horizon and rebalancing: single static allocation held for the full 10\u2011year horizon (no interim rebalancing).\n- Returns are measured in real terms (inflation adjusted); real risk\u2011free r = 0% for Sharpe computations across scenarios.\n- Scenario priors (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, correlations) are as listed unless replaced by calibrated local estimates; these priors encode the macro narratives of Status Quo, Conflict Escalation, and Diplomatic Normalization.\n- Volatility cap is applied per scenario: portfolio annualized \u03c3 \u2264 15% in each scenario, reflecting moderate risk tolerance of a 58\u2011year\u2011old investor.\n- Portfolio constraints: weights nonnegative, sum to 1, equity cap 50%, fixed\u2011income floor 25% (practical age\u2011based bounds).\n- No leverage or short selling allowed.\n- Minimax objective: maximize the minimum expected annualized Sharpe across the three scenarios (conservative/worst\u2011case focus).\n- Solvability: SOC convexity holds for the fixed\u2011parameter problem and suitable conic solvers are available to find w*.",

Similarly, changing scenario priors or tightening constraints (e.g., enforcing \u03c3_max for Conflict or lowering CVaR threshold) that lead to a materially different optimal w* demonstrates the dependence of the hypothesis on its explicit assumptions; if no feasible w exists under these constraints, the hypothesis (existence of a feasible optimal allocation) is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- The illustrative scenario priors (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s, correlations) approximate plausible 10\u2011year outcomes given Iran\u2019s macro/geopolitical states; domain experts can and should refine them before final computation.\n- Investor is moderate risk tolerant: enforce \u03c3_max = 15% for Status Quo and Normalization; allow higher Conflict volatility but cap tail loss via 95%\u2011CVaR \u2265 \u221260%.\n- No short sales and full investment (w_i \u2265 0, \u2211 w_i = 1).\n- Single\u2011period (static) allocation held for the 10\u2011year horizon (no interim rebalancing).\n- The max\u2011min Sharpe objective and SOCP/bisection solver formulation produce a reliable global optimum under convex feasibility at each bisection step; numerical robustness ensured by auxiliary variables and standard solvers (MOSEK/ECOS).\n- Tail behavior can be approximated sufficiently by sample\u2011based heavy\u2011tailed simulations for CVaR enforcement and validation.",

Numerical stability trivial for 3 assets.\n\n4) Robustness variants (run and report):\n   - Scenario-weighted Sharpe optimization (subjective p_s).\n   - Black\u2011Litterman posterior aggregation then constrained Sharpe maximization.\n   - Box/ellipsoidal uncertainty sets on \u03bc and \u03a3 and worst-case optimization inside them.\n   - Tail-risk constraint/reporting: compute 95%-CVaR of 10\u2011yr cumulative losses per scenario (parametric MC with t\u2011mixture or jump model); include CVaR \u2264 40% as optional constraint and always report CVaR as diagnostic.\n   - Sensitivity: V_max \u2208 {12%,15%,18%}, alternate retirement bounds (e.g., min FI 30%), alternate r_f handling (single global vs scenario-specific).\n\n5) Deliverables after solving:\n   - Optimal static weights w*.\n   - Achieved minimax Sharpe t*, per-scenario Sharpe_s, \u03c3_s, expected nominal returns.\n   - 10\u2011yr median terminal wealth and 95%-CVaR under each scenario and overall envelope.\n   - Sensitivity tables for V_max, bounds, r_f variations, and input perturbations.\n\n6) Practical rationale and intuition:\n   - The strict per-scenario volatility cap (including Conflict) plus high scenario short rates penalize allocations that concentrate in TSE when conflict risk is large. Expect w* to favor a durable fixed-income floor plus meaningful gold exposure as downside hedge; exact weights will depend on calibrated \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, and r_f_s.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThe hypothesis is falsifiable: re-calibrating scenario inputs (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) from independent, defensible local market data or applying an alternative but credible set of scenario parameterizations should produce the same optimal allocation w* under the same formal constraints. If a materially different allocation yields a strictly higher worst\u2011case Sharpe while satisfying all stated constraints under the identical inputs and solver procedure, this hypothesis is false. Empirically, if the realized 10\u2011yr outcomes across the realized regimes produce a minimum realized annualized Sharpe lower than that of an alternative feasible static allocation, the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- Single-period static holding for 10 years; no interim rebalancing or contributions/withdrawals.\n- Asset proxies: broad Tehran Stock Exchange index fund, a domestic gold fund/spot gold proxy, and representative fixed\u2011income funds or short-term government bills/bonds.\n- Nominal returns, volatilities, correlations, and short rates are scenario-specific and reflect macro/geopolitical narratives; seeds above are starting values requiring calibration to local data and inflation expectations.\n- Volatility cap V_max = 15% enforced in every scenario (reflecting moderate risk tolerance for a 58\u2011y/o).\n- Retirement bounds: w_FI \u2265 20%, w_TSE \u2264 40%, w_Gold \u2264 60%; no short selling.\n- SOC/bisection approach is numerically reliable for 3 assets; CVaR tail computations use parametric or MC simulation with scenario-appropriate tail specifications.\n- Optional 95%-CVaR(10\u2011yr) \u2264 40% is treated as an additional robustness variant (to be imposed or reported per governance decisions).",

The claimed solver route is bisection on t with SOC feasibility checks and CVX/CVXPY+MOSEK/ECOS implementations. Below I adopt two personas (Proponent and Skeptic) and then synthesize, with concrete technical checks, likely failure modes, and practical remediation steps.\n\nProponent\n- Mathematical correctness and tractability: The objective (maximize t s.t. for all s, w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t \u00b7 sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w)) is quasiconvex and amenable to a bisection-on-t feasibility approach. For a fixed scalar t the constraints are convex: introduce auxiliary scalar s_s \u2265 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| (SOC) and enforce linear inequalities w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2212 t s_s \u2265 0. This avoids dividing by t and works for t of either sign within the bisection. Numerically with 3 assets the problem is low\u2011dimensional and robust solvers (MOSEK, ECOS) are suitable.\n- Implementation clarity: The proposed weight bounds, per\u2011scenario \u03a3 construction and regularization (\u03b5I) are standard and sufficient for reliable factorization/solver stability. Reporting per\u2011scenario Sharpe, \u03c3, expected returns and CVaR diagnostics is straightforward once simulated or parametric tails are selected.\n- Practical rationale: The constraints (volatility cap + minimum fixed\u2011income floor + retirement bounds) capture a retirement\u2011appropriate tilt to safer assets. The worst\u2011case Sharpe objective directly encodes robustness across geopolitical scenarios and discourages allocations that would perform poorly in any of the three states. The stated robustness variants (BL posterior, uncertainty sets, CVaR constraints) are reasonable extensions.\n\nSkeptic\n- Feasibility concerns (critical): The combination of bounds and a strict per\u2011scenario V_max = 15% may be infeasible for the seeded scenario parameters. Example warning signs in the seeds: in Conflict Escalation (CE) the fixed\u2011income asset has \u03c3_FI = 20%; even a pure fixed\u2011income allocation can yield \u03c3 = 20% > 15%. While diversification and negative correlations can in principle reduce portfolio volatility below the lowest single\u2011asset \u03c3, the seeds show very large volatilities (TSE 60%, Gold 35%) and only modest negative correlations; the feasible set that meets \u03c3_s(w) \u2264 15% in every scenario may be empty given the retirement bounds (w_FI \u2265 0.20) and upper bounds on FI (\u2264 0.80). A numerical feasibility check must be run before optimization.\n- High nominal short rates / sign issues: The scenario r_f values are unusually large (18% in SQ, 50% in CE, 10% in DN). With \u03bc seeds in SQ = [15,10,18] and CE having negative or low \u03bc for some assets, many candidate portfolios will have nonpositive excess returns (w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2264 0). When excess returns are negative, the Sharpe is negative and the constraint form needs careful handling. The proposal states \"each constraint is SOC when RHS nonnegative\" \u2014 this is misleading: dividing by t is not required; correct implementation uses auxiliary vars as above. Also if the maximum worst\u2011case Sharpe t* is nonpositive, bisection initialized over only positive t will incorrectly conclude infeasibility; the bisection interval must cover negative t as well.\n- Interpretability/nominal vs real returns: The inputs are nominal. In markets with very high inflation/short rates (Iran context), comparing nominal \u03bc to nominal r_f is internally consistent, but for retiree welfare and real purchasing power it is more appropriate to model real returns (and real short rate) or explicitly model inflation scenarios. Using nominal r_f without adjusting either returns or investor liabilities may yield allocations that are optimal nominally but poor in real terms.\n- Hidden assumptions about asset proxies and implementability: The hypothesis assumes liquid, low\u2011cost proxies for Tehran Stock Exchange index funds, gold funds, and representative fixed\u2011income products with the specified returns and volatilities. In practice: (a) onshore investors may face capital controls, transaction costs, or illiquidity (especially for gold or TSE products); (b) fixed\u2011income of the stated return/vol profiles may not be available at the assumed durations/credit risk; (c) currency risk and inflation erosion are material for a 58\u2011year\u2011old. These real\u2011world frictions can invalidate the numeric optimal allocation unless modeled.\n- Tail risk/CVaR as a constraint: A 95% CVaR(10y) \u2264 40% cap is reasonable as a diagnostic, but imposing it as a hard constraint may make the problem infeasible depending on tail model assumptions. Parametric CVaR (Gaussian) will understate tail risk when returns are fat\u2011tailed, and MC with jumps/t\u2011mixtures increases computational and modeling burden.\n\nSynthesis and concrete checks / prescriptions\n1) Pre\u2011optimization feasibility checks (do these before running bisection):\n   - For each scenario s, solve min_w \u03c3_s(w) subject to 1'w=1, w \u2265 0 and the retirement bounds. If min \u03c3_s(w) > V_max for any s, the stated per\u2011scenario volatility cap is infeasible and must be relaxed or bounds adjusted. This is a small convex QP/SOC problem and cheap to run.\n   - For each scenario, compute maximum attainable excess return per unit volatility (single\u2011asset and unconstrained portfolio) to get rough upper/lower bounds on feasible t. Use these to seed bisection interval [t_low, t_high] (allow t_low negative).\n2) Correct SOC formulation (implementation note): Implement bisection on t, and for each fixed t solve the convex feasibility problem:\n   - Variables: w, and for each scenario s an auxiliary scalar s_s.\n   - Constraints: s_s \u2265 ||\u03a3_s^{1/2} w|| (SOC); w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2212 t s_s \u2265 0 (linear); s_s \u2265 0; 1'w=1; w bounds.\n   This avoids any division by t and handles t of either sign. Solvers: CVXPY with MOSEK/ECOS or CVX (Matlab) will handle these SOC+linear constraints reliably.\n3) Numerical conditioning and regularization:\n   - Add tiny diagonal \u03b5I to \u03a3_s (e.g., \u03b5 = 1e\u22126 to 1e\u22124 scaled to variances) to ensure PSD and robust sqrt operations.\n   - Use high\u2011precision solver tolerances when exploring feasibility vs near\u2011infeasibility (set feasibility tolerance smaller than 1e\u22126 if solver allows).\n4) r_f and return scaling / real vs nominal:\n   - Decide whether objective is nominal Sharpe or real Sharpe. If the investor cares about purchasing power, express \u03bc_s and r_f_s in real terms by subtracting scenario inflation. Alternatively report both nominal and real results, and rerun feasibility checks with real returns.\n5) CVaR and tail modeling:\n   - For diagnostics, compute 10\u2011yr cumulative returns via parametric simulation: consider t\u2011mixture or jump models (or bootstrapped historical residuals adjusted for scenario means). Report 95% CVaR per scenario but don't impose it as a hard constraint until you confirm it's feasible; if you must, treat it as a convex constraint under the chosen parametric family or approximate using linear CVaR formulations with scenario samples.\n6) Sensitivity and governance:\n   - Produce a feasibility envelope table: V_max \u2208 {12%,15%,18%}, min FI \u2208 {20%,30%,40%}, and per\u2011scenario r_f variations. Show how often the per\u2011scenario feasibility fails.\n   - If per\u2011scenario volatility caps are the primary business requirement, recommend re\u2011stating them relative to the lowest achievable \u03c3 across scenarios (i.e., choose V_max larger than max_s min_w \u03c3_s(w)).\n7) Falsifiability / testing protocol:\n   - Calibrate \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s from local market history + expert judgment and run bootstrap/MCMC to produce distributions of w*. If alternate credible calibrations produce materially different w* (beyond governance tolerances), the hypothesis that \"the specified w* is the correct minimax solution under the given constraints\" is rejected. Also compare realized ex post worst\u2011case Sharpe against competitor feasible allocations across realized regimes.\n\nPractical implementability for a 58\u2011year\u2011old Iranian investor\n- The formal retirement bounds and per\u2011scenario volatility cap do capture risk aversion, but the specific numeric choices should be validated with the investor\u2019s real spending needs and inflation expectations. In an environment with high nominal rates and inflation, a real\u2011return perspective and liquidity constraints (e.g., access to onshore FI instruments) are essential.\n- Minimum FI = 20% may be too low for some 58\u2011year\u2011olds; consider governance tests with 30\u201350% FI minima.\n\nHidden assumptions (explicitly flagged)\n- \u03bc_s and \u03a3_s are stationary over the 10\u2011yr horizon (no regime transitions within a scenario beyond the scenario's narrative)\n- Asset proxies exist and are tradable/liquid with the assumed parameters\n- No transaction costs, taxation, or withdrawal patterns\n- Inflation is not explicitly modeled (nominal returns used)\n- CVaR parametric assumptions (if used) are representative of tails\n\nBottom line assessment\n- The high\u2011level idea (minimax Sharpe with per\u2011scenario volatility caps and retirement bounds) is methodologically sound and implementable, but the current seeds/constraints contain crucial feasibility and sign\u2011consistency issues that must be checked and addressed before claiming success. The stated SOC/bisection mechanics need the auxiliary\u2011variable formulation to avoid the \"RHS nonnegative\" pitfall and to allow bisection over a signed t interval. Also adjust for nominal vs real return interpretation and run simple per\u2011scenario feasibility diagnostics first.\n\nRequested next actions (for the workflow):\n1) Run three per\u2011scenario min\u2011variance problems subject to current bounds to test V_max feasibility. If any infeasible, flag which constraints (V_max or bounds) to relax.\n2) Implement the SOC formulation with s_s variables and bisection over a signed interval; seed interval using per\u2011scenario single\u2011asset Sharpe upper bounds.\n3) Report w*, t*, per\u2011scenario metrics and CVaR diagnostics; then run sensitivity sweeps for V_max and min FI.\n\nNote: No literature file was attached for grounding. Provide a --literature-file (empirical TSE returns, local inflation/time series, and proxy fund characteristics) to calibrate \u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, and r_f_s and to reduce idiosyncratic model risk."

If the stated per\u2011scenario volatility cap is infeasible with credible priors, feasibility requires recalibrating scenario volatilities or relaxing the per\u2011scenario constraint (see Detailed Description).\n\n#### Detailed Description for Domain Experts\nModel objective (minimax Sharpe; static single\u2011period held for 10 years):\n- Decision variable: w = [w_TSE, w_Gold, w_FI], w_i \u2265 0, \u2211 w_i = 1.\n- For each scenario s \u2208 {SQ, CE, DN} define \u03bc_s (annual expected returns, nom.), \u03a3_s (annual covariance), and r_f_s (annual risk\u2011free / short yield).\n- For given w, scenario s annual Sharpe: SR_s(w) = (w' \u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s) / sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w).\n- Optimization (SOCP formulation via bisection on t or direct conic form):\n    maximize t\n    subject to, for each scenario s:\n       w' \u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t \u00b7 sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w)    (ensures SR_s(w) \u2265 t)\n       sqrt(w' \u03a3_s w) \u2264 V_max = 0.15\n    plus w_FI \u2265 0.35, w \u2265 0, \u2211 w = 1.\n- Solver / computation: cast constraints as second\u2011order cones and solve using cvxpy + Mosek (or other conic solver). Solve for maximal t (the worst\u2011scenario Sharpe) by bisection or direct conic maximization.\n\nBaseline scenario parameter priors (annualized, to be calibrated locally \u2014 use as working baseline):\n- Status Quo (SQ): persistent sanctions, chronic inflation, economic drag\n    r_f_SQ = 22%; \u03bc_SQ = [TSE: 25%, Gold: 15%, FI: 22%]; \u03c3 = [30%, 22%, 12%]; Corr(TSE,Gold)=0.1, Corr(TSE,FI)=0.2, Corr(Gold,FI)=0.0.\n- Conflict Escalation (CE): direct conflict, hyperinflation, severe equity crash\n    r_f_CE = 60%; \u03bc_CE = [TSE: \u221240%, Gold: 80%, FI: 20%]; \u03c3 = [60%, 35%, 30%]; Corr(TSE,Gold)=\u22120.3, Corr(TSE,FI)=0.4, Corr(Gold,FI)=\u22120.2.\n- Diplomatic Normalization (DN): sanctions relief, stabilization, growth\n    r_f_DN = 12%; \u03bc_DN = [TSE: 35%, Gold: 5%, FI: 12%]; \u03c3 = [25%, 18%, 10%]; Corr(TSE,Gold)=0.0, Corr(TSE,FI)=0.3, Corr(Gold,FI)=0.0.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Use \u03a3_s built from \u03c3_s and Corr matrix. For each candidate w and t, the constraint w'\u03bc_s \u2212 r_f_s \u2265 t\u00b7sqrt(w'\u03a3_s w) is an SOC constraint after introducing auxiliary variables.\n- Perform robust checks: (i) \u03bc uncertainty sets (ellipsoidal \u00b12\u20135%), (ii) covariance scaling (1.0\u20131.5) and heavy tails (t\u2011distributed draws, df\u22485) for stress tests, (iii) sensitivity to V_max (12% and 18%) and to the w_FI floor (no floor / 25% / 50%).\n- Produce both the constrained run (w_FI \u2265 35%) and unconstrained baseline for comparison; report SR_s(w), portfolio vol by scenario, and worst\u2011case SR (t*).\n- Diagnostics: if the problem is infeasible under the per\u2011scenario V_max = 15% (likely if CE vol priors are extremely high), then either (A) relax the per\u2011scenario cap to apply only to SQ and DN and allow a higher cap in CE (e.g., 20\u201325%), or (B) revisit and calibrate priors (especially \u03a3_CE and FI volatility) to local market data and realistic shock bounds.\n\nRationale and expected shape:\n- Conflict Escalation creates high TSE volatility and a negative expected equity return; thus the minimax Sharpe solution will reduce TSE exposure and increase FI and gold to preserve worst\u2011case Sharpe while meeting the moderate\u2011volatility objective.\n- Gold serves as conditional hedge (positive expected return and negative/low correlation in CE), while fixed income supplies income and lower nominal volatility in benign regimes \u2014 hence FI floor and dominance in the result.\n\n#### Falsifiability Statement\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable in several testable ways:\n- Numerical refutation: If, after calibrating \u03a3_s and \u03bc_s to credible local data and solving the stated SOCP exactly, the resulting optimal static allocation falls outside the proposed ranges (w_FI \u2209 [0.40,0.60] or w_Gold \u2209 [0.15,0.35] or w_TSE \u2209 [0.05,0.25]) while still satisfying the per\u2011scenario V_max = 15% and w_FI \u2265 35%, the hypothesis is falsified.\n- Feasibility refutation: If the stated constraints (notably the per\u2011scenario 15% volatility cap applied to CE with the baseline priors) are infeasible and no realistic recalibration of priors (within domain\u2011plausible bounds) makes the problem feasible, the hypothesis (as stated, including the per\u2011scenario cap) is falsified and must be revised to relax the cap or change priors.\n- Out\u2011of\u2011sample fail: Over the realized 10\u2011year horizon, if the chosen static allocation yields realized worst\u2011scenario Sharpe materially below the model\u2019s predicted worst\u2011case Sharpe (after accounting for estimation error and transaction costs), and this shortfall cannot be explained by tail events beyond assumed stress bounds, then the hypothesis is empirically falsified.\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n1. Scenario narratives and baseline priors (\u03bc_s, \u03a3_s, r_f_s) reasonably represent plausible 10\u2011year outcomes for Iran; these priors will be calibrated to IRR\u2011denominated data where possible.\n2. Single\u2011period static allocation held for 10 years (no interim rebalancing or contributions/withdrawals).\n3. Nonnegativity (no short selling) and fully invested constraint (weights sum to 1).\n4. Volatility cap V_max = 15% is applied per scenario (conservative posture for age 58); feasibility contingent on priors.\n5. Fixed\u2011income floor w_FI \u2265 35% reflects income and liquidity needs for the 58\u2011year\u2011old investor.\n6. Market frictions (transaction costs, taxes, liquidity constraints) are secondary and can be layered post\u2011optimization; returns are nominal and measured in IRR.\n7. Covariances and returns are reasonably stationary within each scenario for the 10\u2011year horizon (i.e., scenario parameters summarize the distribution over the decade).\n\nNext computational step (if the panel accepts): run the SOCP described above with the baseline priors and constraints (V_max = 15% per scenario; w_FI \u2265 35%) and report the precise optimal weights, per\u2011scenario Sharpe and vol, and sensitivity analyses. If infeasible, report the minimal relaxation required (which constraint and by how much) to restore feasibility.",

Limitations include potential selection bias toward accessible or English-language sources, variable quality of web-hosted papers, and reliance on summarized findings rather than full-method verification. Iranian market data cited in web sources can be incomplete, noisy, or lagged; scenario calibration is subjective; model results depend strongly on chosen uncertainty sets and input assumptions; and implementation constraints (capital controls, liquidity limits, currency/reflation dynamics) may limit real-world applicability. For policy or final allocation decisions, supplement this web evidence with peer-reviewed studies, primary TSE and macroeconomic data, and in-sample/out-of-sample backtesting.",

Incorporating endogenous expectations can make the optimization more realistic and may explain stability of recommended weights despite large changes in assumed returns.",
